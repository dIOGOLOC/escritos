	abstract = {P-{SH} conversion is commonly observed in teleseismic P waves, and is often attributed to dipping interfaces beneath the receiver. Our modelling suggests an alternative explanation in terms of flat-layered anisotropy. We use reflectivity techniques to compute three-component synthetic seismograms in a 1-D anisotropic layered medium. For each layer of the medium, we prescribe values of seismic velocities and hexagonally symmetric anisotropy about a common symmetry axis of arbitrary orientation. A compressional wave in an anisotropic velocity structure suffers conversion to both {SV-and} {SH-polarized} shear waves, unless the axis of symmetry is everywhere vertical or the wave travels parallel to all symmetry axes. The P-{SV} conversion forms the basis of the widely used ‘receiver function’ technique. The P-{SH} conversion occurs at interfaces where one or both layers are anisotropic. A tilted axis of symmetry and a dipping interface in isotropic media produce similar amplitudes of both direct (P) and converted (Ps) phases, leaving the backazimuth variation of the P-Ps delay as the main discriminant. Seismic anisotropy with a tilted symmetry axis leads to complex synthetic seismograms in velocity models composed of just a few flat homogeneous layers. It is possible therefore to model observations of P coda with prominent transverse components with relatively simple 1-D velocity structures. Successful retrieval of salient model characteristics appears possible using multiple realizations of a genetic-algorithm ({GA)} inversion of P coda from several backazimuths. Using {GA} inversion, we determine that six P coda recorded at station {ARU} in central Russia are consistent with models that possess strong ({\textgreater} 10 per cent) anisotropy in the top 5 km and between 30 and 43 km depth. The symmetry axes are tilted, and appear aligned with the seismic anisotropy orientation in the mantle under {ARU} suggested by {SKS} splitting.},

	abstract = {O Rift continental do Sudeste do Brasil ({RCSB)}, de idade cenozóica, é uma feição alongada e deprimida, desenvolvida entre as cidades de Curitiba ({PR)} e Niterói ({RJ)}, numa extensão de pelo menos 800 km. Segue grosseiramente a linha de costa atual, da qual dista em média cerca de 70 km, alcançando o Atlântico na sua terminação nordeste. O segmento mais contínuo desse rift, entre as cidades de São Paulo ({SP)} e Volta Redonda ({RJ)}, com cerca de 350 km de comprimento, foi objeto de estudo no presente trabalho, no tocante aos seus aspectos de tectonia e sedimentação. Com base principalmente na análise microestrutural e na análise de fácies sedimentares, amparadas em dados mineralógicos, palinológicos, geocronológicos e geomorfológicos, entre outros, pôde ser estabelecida de forma tentativa, a seguinte seqüência de eventos para a área estudada: a) Paleógeno (Eoceno-Oligoceno): formação da depressão original (hemi-graben), contínua na porção analisada, como resultado do campo de esforços extensionais de direção {NNW-SSE} imposto pelo basculamento termomecânico na Bacia de Santos; preenchimento vulcano-sedimentar sintectônico (Grupo Taubaté), compreendendo um sistema de leques aluviais associados à planície aluvial de rios entrelaçados (Formação Resende), basal e lateral na bacia, um sistema playa-lake (Formação tremembé), e um sistema fluvial meandrante (Formação São Paulo); eclosão de derrames de basanito a sudeste de Volta Redonda (Basanito Casa de Pedra), associados ao sistema fanglomerático; condições climáticas inicialmente semi-áridas, durante a sedimentação das formações Resende e Tremembé, passando para úmidas durante a deposição da Formação São Paulo; b) Neógeno (Mioceno ?): transcorrência sinistral de direção E-W, com extensão {NW-SE} e localmente compressão {NE-SW;} geração de soleiras (Arujá, Queluz, entre outras) relacionadas à transpressão, ou bacias tipo pull-apart (sistema fluvial entrelaçado da Formação Itaquaquecetuba), associadas à transtração ou relaxamento final dos esforços dessa fase; separação das drenagens dos rios Tietê e Paraíba do Sul pela Soleira de Arujá, com mudança do nível de base e erosão na porção central da Bacia de Taubaté; c) Plioceno (?) a Pleistoceno Inferior: implantação de novo sistema fluvial meandrante (Formação Pindamonhangaba), na área da Bacia de Taubaté, em condições provavelmente quentes e úmidas; d) Pleistoceno Superior: inicialmente fase de estabilidade tectônica com a deposição de sedimentos colúvio-aluviais, frutos do remodelamento do relevo em função das variações climáticas; ao final, nova fase transcorrente E-W, agora dextral, com compressão {NW-SE} e geração de novas soleiras; definição de distribuição atual dos sedimentos nas bacias, ou embaciamentos, num arranjo lazy-Z; e) Holoceno: nova extensão {NW} ({WNW)} - {SE} ({ESE)}, afetando depósitos de baixos terraços ligados à evolução da rede de drenagem do Rio Paraíba do Sul; f) Atual: campo de tensões indicando compressão, sugestivo de nova mudança no regime de esforços. A alternância entre transcorrência sinistral e dextral e, conseqüentemente, de esforços trativos para compreensivos, respectivamente, estaria relacionada provavelmente ao balanço entre as taxas de abertura na Cadeia Meso-Atlântica e de subducção da Placa de Nazca sob a Placa Sul Americana. A deriva desta última para oeste, em relação às estruturas antigas do {RCSB}, proporcionaria transcorrência dextral quando a taxa de abertura excedesse a de subducção e transcorrência sinistral no caso oposto. O quadro tectono-sedimentar estabelecido apresenta implicações para a geologia econômica e de engenharia da área de estudo, sendo apresentadas breves considerações a esse respeito ao final do trabalho.},

	abstract = {[1] We present a method for the measurement of spatially variable signal-to-noise ({S/N)} ratios in multichannel teleseismic receiver function ({RF)} images. The {S/N} ratio is defined as a measure of coherency of the final image, and the approach is applicable to any {RF} imaging technique that employs mapping of the records into depth followed by their summation as the final signal enhancement step. In such methods, all of the converted phases become horizontally aligned in the depth domain, and their coherent (signal) and incoherent (noise) components can be estimated by using stacking statistics. For 10 locations along two subarrays of the Continental Dynamics of Rocky Mountains Project ({CD-ROM)} teleseismic array, after a limited {RF} editing, we apply our method to the image resulting from three-dimensional (3-D) prestack {RF} depth migration. The resulting amplitude {S/N} values to vary from 0.1 to 0.3 in the individual {RFs} and from 1 to 5 in the final image, with significant spatial variability. These moderate {S/N} values argue in favor of sampling redundancy achieved in array recording and multichannel {RF} processing. In order to further reduce noise in {RF} images, denser and longer deployments or additional signal enhancement techniques are advisable. Because of its ability to provide direct assessment of image quality in three dimensions, including its dependence on the frequency band and data coverage, our method can also be potentially used for real-time array tuning and image focusing required for moving arrays proposed for the {USArray} program.},

The method presented can easily be extended to phase-weighted cross-correlations or be applied in the τp domain. We illustrate and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of {PWS} in comparison with other coherency measures and present examples. We further show that our non-linear stacking technique enables us to detect a weak lower-mantle P-to-S conversion from a depth of approximately 840 km on array data. Hints of an 840 km discontinuity have been reported; however, such a discontinuity is not yet established due to the lack of further evidence.},

We consider point crustal thicknesses from seismic refraction experiments, receiver function analyses, and surface-wave dispersion. Estimates of crustal thickness derived from gravity anomalies were only included along the continental shelf and in some areas of the Andes to fill large gaps in seismic coverage. Two crustal models were developed: A) by simple interpolation of the point estimates, and B) our preferred model, based on the same point estimates, interpolated with surface-wave tomography. Despite gaps in continental coverage, both models reveal interesting crustal thickness variations. In the Andean range, the crust reaches 75 km in Southern Peru and the Bolivian Altiplano, while crustal thicknesses seem to be close to the global continental average ({\textasciitilde} 40 km) in Ecuador and southern Colombia (despite high elevations), and along the southern Andes of {Chile–Argentina} (elevation lower than 2000 m). In the stable continental platform the average thickness is 38 ± 5 km (1-st. deviation) and no systematic differences are observed among {Archean–Paleoproterozoic} cratons, {NeoProterozoic} fold belts, and low-altitude intracratonic sedimentary basins. An exception is the Borborema Province ({NE} Brazil) with crust {\textasciitilde} 30–35 km thick. Narrow belts surrounding the cratons are suggested in central Brazil, parallel to the eastern and southern border of the Amazon craton, and possibly along the {TransBrasiliano} Lineament continuing into the Chaco basin, where crust thinner than 35 km is observed. In the sub-Andean region, between the mid-plate cratons and the Andean cordillera, the crust tends to be thinner ({\textasciitilde} 35 km) than the average crust in the stable platform, a feature possibly inherited from the old pre-Cambrian history of the continent. We expect that these crustal models will be useful for studies of isostasy, dynamic topography, and crustal evolution of the continent.},

We selected a large number of 1-hr waveform segments during a 3-yr period, from 2001 to 2003, from continuous data collected by the {U.S.} National Seismograph Network and the Advanced National Seismic System ({ANSS).}
For each segment of continuous data, the {PSD} is estimated and smoothed in full-octave averages at 1/8 octave intervals. Powers for each 1/8 period interval were then accumulated in 1-{dB} power bins. A statistical analysis of power bins yields probability density functions ({PDFs)} as a function of noise power for each of the octave bands at each station and component. There is no need to account for earthquakes since they map into a background probability level. A comparison of day and night {PDFs} and an examination of artifacts related to station operation and episodic cultural noise allow us to estimate both the overall station quality and the level of earth noise at each site. Percentage points of the {PDFs} have been derived to form the basis for noise maps of the contiguous United States at body-wave frequencies.
The results of our noise analysis are useful for characterizing the performance of existing broadband stations and for detecting operational problems and should be relevant to the future siting of {ANSS} backbone stations. The noise maps at body-wave frequencies should be useful for estimating the magnitude threshold for the {ANSS} backbone and regional networks or conversely for optimizing the distribution of regional network stations.},

	abstract = {We experiment with backprojection migration processing of teleseismic receiver functions from the Snake River Plain ({SRP)} broadband seismic experiment. Previous analyses of data from this experiment have used a common midpoint ({CMP)} stacking approach, a method widely applied for analysis of P-{SV} converted phases (receiver functions) to obtain high-resolution imaging of upper mantle discontinuities. The {CMP} technique assumes that all P-{SV} conversions are produced by flat-lying structures and may not properly image dipping, curved, or laterally discontinuous interfaces. In this paper we adopt a backprojection migration scheme to solve for an array of point scatterers that best produces the large suite of observed receiver functions. We first perform synthetic experiments that illustrate the potential improvement of migration processing over {CMP} stacks. Application of the migration processing to the {SRP} data set shows most of the major features as in the original {CMP} work, but with a weaker 410-km discontinuity and a more intermittent discontinuity at 250 km apparent depth. Random resampling tests are also performed to assess the robustness of subtle features in our discontinuity images. These tests show that a 20-km elevation of the 660-km discontinuity directly beneath the Snake River Plain is robust, but that the variations in 410-km discontinuity topography that we observe are not stable upon resampling. {“Bright} spots” near 250 km apparent depth are robust upon resampling, but interpretation of these features is complicated by possible sidelobe artifacts from topside Moho reverberations.},

We used crustal thicknesses mainly derived from seismic datasets such as deep seismic refraction experiments, receiver function analyses, and surface-wave dispersion velocities. Crustal thicknesses derived from modelling gravity anomalies commonly depend on assumptions, such as constant density contrast across the Moho interface, which are not always easily verifiable and were considered only along the continental shelf to fill large gaps in the seismic data. Our compilation shows that the crust in the stable continental area onshore has an average thickness of 39 ± 5 km (1-σ deviation) and that no clear difference can be observed between low altitude, intracratonic sedimentary basins, {NeoProterozoic} foldbelts (except for the Borborema Province), and cratonic areas. The thinnest crust is found in the Borborema Province of {NE} Brazil (30–35 km) and along a narrow belt within Tocantins Province (∼35 km), roughly parallel to the Eastern border of the Amazon craton, while the thickest crust is found in the Amazon and São Francisco cratons (41 ± 4 km), and the Paraná Basin (42 ± 4 km). Both the Ponta Grossa and the Rio Grande Arches are areas of thinned crust, and the western border of the Brazilian platform, near the sub-Andean region, seems to be characterized by a crustal thickness of less than 40 km. Although sparse in data coverage, we expect the resulting crustal thickness map to be useful for future studies of isostasy, dynamic topography, and crustal evolution of the country.},

	abstract = {Combined P and S receiver functions from seismograms of teleseismic events recorded at 65 temporary and permanent stations in the Aegean region are used to map the geometry of the subducted African and the overriding Aegean plates. We image the Moho of the subducting African plate at depths ranging from 40 km beneath southern Crete and the western Peloponnesus to 160 km beneath the volcanic arc and 220 km beneath northern Greece. However, the dip of the Moho of the subducting African plate is shallower beneath the Peloponnesus than beneath Crete and Rhodes and flattens out beneath the northern Aegean. Observed P-to-S conversions at stations located in the forearc indicate a reversed velocity contrast at the Moho boundary of the Aegean plate, whereas this boundary is observed as a normal velocity contrast by the S-to-P conversions. Our modeling suggests that the presence of a large amount of serpentinite (more than 30\%) in the forearc mantle wedge, which generally occurs in the subduction zones, may be the reason for the reverse sign of the P-to-S conversion coefficient. Moho depths for the Aegean plate show that the southern part of the Aegean (crustal thickness of 20–22 km) has been strongly influenced by extension, while the northern Aegean Sea, which at present undergoes the highest crustal deformation, shows a relatively thicker crust (25–28 km). This may imply a recent initiation of the present kinematics in the Aegean. Western Greece (crustal thickness of 32–40 km) is unaffected by the recent extension but underwent crustal thickening during the Hellenides Mountains building event. The depths of the Aegean Moho beneath the margin of the Peloponnesus and Crete (25–28 and 25–33 km, respectively) show that these areas are also likely to be affected by the Aegean extension, even though the Cyclades (crustal thickness of 26–30 km) were not significantly involved in this episode. The Aegean lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary ({LAB)} mapped with S receiver functions is about 150 km deep beneath mainland Greece, whereas the {LAB} of the subducted African plate dips from 100 km beneath Crete and the southern Aegean Sea to about 225 km under the volcanic arc. This implies a thickness of 60–65 km for the subducted African lithosphere, suggesting that the Aegean lithosphere was not significantly affected by the extensional process associated with the exhumation of metamorphic core complexes in the Cyclades.},

Receiver functions were calculated from the quiet short-period seismograms recorded by a recently deployed borehole network, Hi-net. We found that a relatively broad frequency band can be retrieved from a short-period seismogram by a deconvolution of the instrument response. The quality of the receiver functions formed from large earthquake recordings is comparable to those from broadband instruments. We applied common-conversion-point gathering to the receiver-function data to image the P to S conversion events beneath the network by stacking with a 4th root technique to improve lateral coherence. We found that the topographic anomalies of the 410- and 660-km discontinuities beneath southwest Japan have very different length scales. The former is characterized by a narrow, ∼150–200 km wide, topographic high, while the latter exhibits a broad, {\textgreater} 400 km wide, moderate topographic low together with a small-scale, larger-amplitude depression. A {2.5D} pre-stack depth migration of the receiver functions shows the transition zone features clearly, as well as images of a change of slope in the subducting slab at the 410 discontinuity and flattening of the slab onto the 660-km. These observations show that the subducted Pacific slab is deflected when it encounters the upper and lower boundaries of the transition zone, and is flat lying either above or across the 660-km discontinuity. The flat lying slab is, however, restricted to the bottom of the transition zone, and probably experiences much less thickening than is suggested by some global tomographic images in which subhorizontal high velocity anomalies are seen throughout the transition zone between the two discontinuities.},

	abstract = {The number of broadband three-component seismic stations in southern California has more than tripled recently. In this study we use the teleseismic receiver function technique to determine the crustal thicknesses and {Vp/Vs} ratios for these stations and map out the lateral variation of Moho depth under southern California. It is shown that a receiver function can provide a very good “point” measurement of crustal thickness under a broadband station and is not sensitive to crustal P velocity. However, the crustal thickness estimated only from the delay time of the Moho P-to-S converted phase trades off strongly with the crustal {Vp/Vs} ratio. The ambiguity can be reduced significantly by incorporating the later multiple converted phases, namely, the {PpPs} and {PpSs+PsPs.} We propose a stacking algorithm which sums the amplitudes of receiver function at the predicted arrival times of these phases by different crustal thicknesses H and {Vp/Vs} ratios. This transforms the time domain receiver functions directly into the H-{Vp/Vs} domain without need to identify these phases and to pick their arrival times. The best estimations of crustal thickness and {Vp/Vs} ratio are found when the three phases are stacked coherently. By stacking receiver functions from different distances and directions, effects of lateral structural variation are suppressed, and an average crustal model is obtained. Applying this technique to 84 digital broadband stations in southern California reveals that the Moho depth is 29 km on average and varies from 21 to 37 km. Deeper Mohos are found under the eastern Transverse Range, the Peninsular Range, and the Sierra Nevada Range. The central Transverse Range, however, does not have a crustal root. Thin crusts exist in the Inner California Borderland (21–22 km) and the Salton Trough (22 km). The Moho is relatively flat at the average depth in the western and central Mojave Desert and becomes shallower to the east under the Eastern California Shear Zone ({ECSZ).} Southern California crust has an average {Vp/Vs} ratio of 1.78, with higher ratios of 1.8 to 1.85 in the mountain ranges with Mesozoic basement and lower ratios in the Mojave Block except for the {ECSZ}, where the ratio increases.},

	abstract = {The use of broadband receiver function analysis to estimate the fine-scale S-velocity structure of the lithosphere is becoming increasingly popular. A series of numerical experiments shows several important aspects of this technique, with emphasis on estimation of dipping interfaces. The recent modification introduced to the receiver function analysis technique that preserves absolute amplitudes (Ammon, 1991) is more robust than the previous technique of modeling receiver functions that were normalized to unit amplitude. Using the latter method, shallow (e.g., depths less than ∼2 km) high-velocity contrast interfaces may alter the apparent amplitudes of Ps phases and produce inaccuracies in the Earth model developed. The use of absolute amplitudes minimizes this potential for error. When research targets include deep dipping structure, tight stacking bounds (e.g., ≦ 10° in backazimuth ({BAZ)} and epicentral distance (Δ)) should be applied to avoid attenuating Ps phases and to aid in the identification of reverberations or scattered energy. Reverberations sample a relatively large lateral range about the recording site (e.g., a radius of 1 to 1.5 times the depth of the reflecting interface) and in the presence of dipping interfaces exhibit drastic variations in amplitude and arrival time as a function of {BAZ} and Δ. Thus, they cannot readily be used to provide constraints on the Earth structure. Formal inversion techniques, which attempt to match all arrivals in the waveform, must be used with caution when modeling receiver functions from complex regions. Only those phases whose amplitude and arrival-time variations as a function of {BAZ} and Δ are consistent with those of Ps conversions should be modeled. Forward modeling may resolve, depending upon the data quality and noise level, S-velocity contrasts greater than ∼ 0.2 to 0.4 km / sec. Layers of thickness 2 to 5 km may be accurately imaged, and transition zones may be examined by considering various frequency bands of the data. In order to better understand the resolving power of the data, the averaging functions associated with the receiver functions may be calculated from the observed data and, if desired, used in the forward modeling process.},

	abstract = {P-to-S converted waves at the continental Moho together with waves multiply reflected between the Earth’s surface and the Moho have been used to estimate the Moho depth and average crustal {Vp/Vs} variations in the central Andes. Our analysis confirms and significantly complements the Moho depth estimates previously obtained from wide-angle seismic studies and receiver functions. The resulting crustal thickness varies from about 35 km in the forearc region to more than 70 km beneath the plateau and thins (30 km) further to the east in the Chaco plains. Beneath the Andean plateau, the Moho is deeper in the north (Altiplano) and shallower in the south (Puna), where the plateau attains its maximum elevation. A non-linear relation exists between crustal thickness and elevation (and Bouguer gravity), suggesting that the crust shallower than 50–55 km is predominately felsic in contrast to a predominately mafic crust below. Such a relation also implies a 100 km thick thermal lithosphere beneath the Altiplano and with a lithospheric thinning of a few tens of kilometers beneath the Puna. Absence of expected increase in lithospheric thickness in regions of almost doubled crust strongly suggests partial removal of the mantle lithosphere beneath the entire plateau. In the Subandean ranges at {19–20°S}, the relation between altitude and crustal thickness indicates a thick lithosphere (up to 130–150 km) and lithospheric flexure. Beneath a relative topographic low at the Salar de Atacama, a thick crust (67 km) suggests that the lithosphere in this region is abnormally cold and dynamically subsided, possibly due to coupling with the subducting plate. This may be related to the strongest (Ms=8.0) known intra-slab earthquake in the central Andes that happened very close to this region in 1950. The average crustal {Vp/Vs} ratio is about 1.77 for the {Altiplano–Puna} and it reaches the highest values (1.80–1.85) beneath the volcanic arc, indicating high ambient crustal temperatures and wide-spread intra-crustal melting.},

High-resolution lateral variations of the crustal structure for individual geographic provinces are investigated, and distinctive features are identified. The crustal structure is strongly heterogeneous beneath the central Transverse Ranges, and deep Moho of 36–39 km is locally observed beneath several station groups in the western San Gabriel Mountains. Moho is relatively flat and smooth beneath the western Mojave Desert but gets shallower and complicated to the east.

	abstract = {Crustal structure in South America is one of the least understood among the Earth's continental areas. Variations in crustal thickness are still poorly constrained over large portions of the continent because of scarce or unevenly distributed crustal thickness estimates throughout South America. To address this scarce and inhomogeneous data cover we explore the possibility to derive crustal thickness from satellite gravity data. In this study, we utilize the combined gravity model {EIGEN-6C}, which is composed of {GOCE} and other gravity data. The Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer ({GOCE)} satellite has a much more uniform spatial resolution than any land-based gravity or seismic survey in South America. The gravity data inversion is for a simple two-layer model with fixed density contrast over the interface, the Moho. The method is not relying on point constraint data and assumes that all of the signal is related to topography of the Moho. Model quality can therefore be assessed by a comparison with point observations on crustal thickness. We show that for the stable part of the continent 90\% of our estimates are similar, within error bounds, to seismic observations. Variations occur in active orogenic zones or regions with suspected non-standard Moho density contrasts. A comparison with seismological models shows a high correlation with the most recent model. Especially in areas where continental and global models of crustal structure have limitations in terms of wave paths or point constraints the gravity based model provides a unique continuity of crustal structure providing new insights on structure and tectonics and increase our understanding of the Earth's structure underneath South America.},

By inverting {RF} amplitudes of the converted phases and their time separations, we produce detailed maps of the seismic properties of the upper and lower oceanic crust of the subducting Cocos plate and its thickness. High Poisson's and {Vp/Vs} ratios due to anomalously low S wave velocity at the upper oceanic crust in the flat slab region may indicate the presence of water and hydrous minerals or high pore pressure. The evidence of high water content within the oceanic crust explains the flat subduction geometry without strong coupling of two plates. This may also explain the nonvolcanic tremor activity and slow slip events occurring in the subducting plate and the overlying crust.},

	abstract = {The deep crustal structure of the Parana Basin of southern Brazil is investigated by analyzing P- and {PP-wave} receiver functions at 17 Brazilian Lithosphere Seismic Project stations within the basin. The study area can be described as a typical Paleozoic intracratonic basin that hosts one of the largest Large Igneous Province of the world and makes a unique setting for investigating models of basin subsidence and their interaction with mantle plumes. Our study consists of (1) an analysis of the Moho interaction phases in the receiver functions to obtain the thickness and bulk {Vp/Vs} ratio of the basin`s underlying crust and (2) a joint inversion with Rayleigh-wave dispersion velocities from an independent tomographic study to delineate the detailed S-wave velocity variation with depth. The results of our analysis reveal that Moho depths and bulk {Vp/Vs} ratios (including sediments) vary between 41 and 48 km and between 1.70 and 1.76, respectively, with the largest values roughly coinciding with the basin`s axis, and that S-wave velocities in the lower crust are generally below 3.8 km/s. Select sites within the basin, however, show lower crustal S-wave velocities slightly above 3.9 km/s suggestive of underplated mafic material. We show that these observations are consistent with a fragmented cratonic root under the Parana basin that defined a zone of weakness for the initial Paleozoic subsidence of the basin and which allowed localized mafic underplating of the crust along the suture zones by Cenozoic magmatism.},

The data were stacked to allow uncertainty estimations and inverted using two global optimization algorithms: simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. Strong and systematic azimuthal dependence was observed in the stacked functions at {CUIG} site, which is located in the Mexican volcanic belt ({MVB).} Assuming a one-dimensional five-layer model per azimuthal stack, these variations were explained with the same upper crustal structure including a superficial ∼2 km-thick low-velocity layer associated with the {MVB} and a well-defined Conrad interface around 15 km depth, different depths for the Moho discontinuity, and variations in both the S-wave velocity and Poisson’s ratio for the upper mantle. Our inversion of observed {RFs} at {CUIG} and theoretical considerations suggest an eastward crustal thickening of at least 5 km below the Valley of Mexico. We tested the sensitivity of the modeling procedure by applying it to the recordings at {ZAIG} station. In this case, no azimuthal dependence was noticed in the stacked functions. After a simultaneous inversion of three different azimuthal stacks, a single four-layer model satisfactorily explained all data, thus revealing a flat one-dimensional crustal model below the Mexican Mesa Central, where {ZAIG} station is located. These results support the resolution and robustness of the applied method at both sites.},

	abstract = {We present new evidence on the seismic velocity and density of the crust and upper mantle along a 200-km-long transect across the eastern Basin and Range and western Colorado Plateau at {37°N} latitude. Receiver functions computed from the P waveforms recorded with 10 portable broadband stations deployed along the transect were used to estimate crustal thickness variations. The crust is 30–35 km thick within the eastern Basin and Range and increases over a distance of ∼100 km at the western edge of the Colorado Plateau, reaching a maximum of approximately 45 km east of the Hurricane fault. The timing of crustal multiples within the reciever functions were used to estimate the {Vp/Vs} of the crust along the profile, and we found that the western Colorado Plateau crust is characterized by a high Poisson's ratio (0.28–0.29) indicative of a crust with an average mafic composition. We estimated the upper mantle lid thickness along our profile based on teleseismic P wave travel times and constraints provided by gravity data. Our data and available geophysical constraints are most consistent with a lithosphere that thickens from an average thickness of 60 km beneath the Basin and Range to 100 km beneath the western Colorado Plateau, although the Basin and Range lithosphere may have significant thickness variations. The thick, strong mafic crust and thicker mantle lid under the Colorado Plateau can account for the relative geologic stability and subdued magmatism of the plateau during Laramide compression and Cenozoic extension compared to surrounding regions. The crustal and lithospheric thinning across the tectonic boundary occurs over a short distance (∼100 km), suggesting it is a geologically young feature produced by a predominantly mechanical response to late Cenozoic extension. Our new lithosphere model at {37°N} latitude is consistent with the existence, in early Cenozoic time, of a flat subducted slab at 100 km depth and a relict Sevier-Laramide 50–60 km thick crustal welt, and 60–100\% pure shear extension (β values of 1.6–2.0) during the late Cenozoic.},

On pourrait ainsi mesurer la vitesse des ondes sismiques entre n'importe quel couple de points de la surface.   Nous présentons tout d'abord la théorie formalisant le lien entre corrélation de bruit et fonction de Green. Nous étudions ensuite l'origine du bruit de fond sismique sur la bande de période 5-40s afin de voir si il respecte ou non les exigences de la théorie. Après avoir évalué la précision des mesures de la vitesse des ondes de surface réalisées grace aux corrélations de bruit, nous étudions les Alpes.

	abstract = {A geometrical ray method is developed for wave calculations involving three-dimensional planar dipping interfaces. Justification for the method is based on analogy with first-motion approximations derived from generalized ray theory where frequency dependence in the reflection-transmission coefficients is related to changes in the complex ray parameter. The method is applied to finding the teleseismic response of an arbitrarily oriented dislocation source in dipping layered media and for receiver calculations which assume an impinging P or S wave beneath a stack of dipping layers. Source results indicate that wave forms from fast azimuthally varying sources, such as strike-slip faults, are significantly distorted from the plane layered case for simple structures. A simple dipping Moho for dips up to 10° does not significantly distort vertical and radial P waves for the receiver response. However, due to azimuth anomalies introduced by interface dip a significant tangential P component is produced. In addition, the S-wave response becomes a function of source mechanism due to the need for specifying the incident polarization angle. Polarization studies are suggested for finding dipping structure.},
