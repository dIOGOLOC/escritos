	abstract = {The concept of instantaneous frequency ({IF}), its definitions, and the correspondence between the various mathematical models formulated for representation of {IF} are discussed. The extent to which the {IF} corresponds to the intuitive expectation of reality is also considered. A historical review of the successive attempts to define the {IF} is presented. The relationships between the {IF} and the group-delay, analytic signal, and bandwidth-time ({BT}) product are explored, as well as the relationship with time-frequency distributions. The notions of monocomponent and multicomponent signals and instantaneous bandwidth are discussed. It is shown that these notions are well described in the context of the theory presented},
