	abstract = {We consider the deconvolution of a suite of teleseismic recordings of the same event in order to separate source and transmission path phenomena. The assumption of source uniformity may restrict the range of azimuths and distances of the seismograms included in the suite. The source shape is estimated by separately averaging the log amplitude spectra and the phase spectra of the recordings. This method of source estimation uses the redundant source information contained in secondary arrivals. The necessary condition for this estimator to resolve the source wavelet is that the travel times of the various secondary arrivals be evenly distributed with respect to the initial arrivals. The subsequent deconvolution of the seismograms is carried out by spectral division with two modifications. The first is the introduction of a minimum allowable source spectral amplitude termed the waterlevel. This parameter constrains the gain of the deconvolution filter in regions where the seismogram has little or no information, and also trades-off arrival time resolution with arrival amplitude resolution. The second modification, designed to increase the time domain resolution of the deconvolution, is the extension of the frequency range of the transmission path impulse response spectrum beyond the optimal passband (the passband of the seismograms). The justification for the extension lies in the fact that the impulse response of the transmission path is itself a series of impulses which means its spectrum is not band-limited. Thus, the impulse response is best represented by a continuous spectrum rather than one which is set to zero outside the optimal passband. This continuity is achieved by a recursive application of a unit-step prediction operator determined by Burg's maximum entropy algorithm. The envelopes of the deconvolution are used to detect the presence of phase shifted arrivals.},

	abstract = {The use of broadband receiver function analysis to estimate the fine-scale S-velocity structure of the lithosphere is becoming increasingly popular. A series of numerical experiments shows several important aspects of this technique, with emphasis on estimation of dipping interfaces. The recent modification introduced to the receiver function analysis technique that preserves absolute amplitudes (Ammon, 1991) is more robust than the previous technique of modeling receiver functions that were normalized to unit amplitude. Using the latter method, shallow (e.g., depths less than ∼2 km) high-velocity contrast interfaces may alter the apparent amplitudes of Ps phases and produce inaccuracies in the Earth model developed. The use of absolute amplitudes minimizes this potential for error. When research targets include deep dipping structure, tight stacking bounds (e.g., ≦ 10° in backazimuth ({BAZ}) and epicentral distance (Δ)) should be applied to avoid attenuating Ps phases and to aid in the identification of reverberations or scattered energy. Reverberations sample a relatively large lateral range about the recording site (e.g., a radius of 1 to 1.5 times the depth of the reflecting interface) and in the presence of dipping interfaces exhibit drastic variations in amplitude and arrival time as a function of {BAZ} and Δ. Thus, they cannot readily be used to provide constraints on the Earth structure. Formal inversion techniques, which attempt to match all arrivals in the waveform, must be used with caution when modeling receiver functions from complex regions. Only those phases whose amplitude and arrival-time variations as a function of {BAZ} and Δ are consistent with those of Ps conversions should be modeled. Forward modeling may resolve, depending upon the data quality and noise level, S-velocity contrasts greater than ∼ 0.2 to 0.4 km / sec. Layers of thickness 2 to 5 km may be accurately imaged, and transition zones may be examined by considering various frequency bands of the data. In order to better understand the resolving power of the data, the averaging functions associated with the receiver functions may be calculated from the observed data and, if desired, used in the forward modeling process.},

	abstract = {The deep crustal structure of the Parana Basin of southern Brazil is investigated by analyzing P- and {PP}-wave receiver functions at 17 Brazilian Lithosphere Seismic Project stations within the basin. The study area can be described as a typical Paleozoic intracratonic basin that hosts one of the largest Large Igneous Province of the world and makes a unique setting for investigating models of basin subsidence and their interaction with mantle plumes. Our study consists of (1) an analysis of the Moho interaction phases in the receiver functions to obtain the thickness and bulk Vp/Vs ratio of the basin`s underlying crust and (2) a joint inversion with Rayleigh-wave dispersion velocities from an independent tomographic study to delineate the detailed S-wave velocity variation with depth. The results of our analysis reveal that Moho depths and bulk Vp/Vs ratios (including sediments) vary between 41 and 48 km and between 1.70 and 1.76, respectively, with the largest values roughly coinciding with the basin`s axis, and that S-wave velocities in the lower crust are generally below 3.8 km/s. Select sites within the basin, however, show lower crustal S-wave velocities slightly above 3.9 km/s suggestive of underplated mafic material. We show that these observations are consistent with a fragmented cratonic root under the Parana basin that defined a zone of weakness for the initial Paleozoic subsidence of the basin and which allowed localized mafic underplating of the crust along the suture zones by Cenozoic magmatism.},

To this end, we analyzed receiver functions from 20 relatively new temporary broadband seismic stations deployed across eastern Brazil. In the analysis we include teleseismic and some regional events, particularly for stations that recorded few suitable earthquakes. We first estimate crustal thickness and average Poisson's ratio using two different stacking methods. We then combine the new crustal constraints with results from previous receiver function studies. To interpolate the crustal thickness between the station locations, we jointly invert these Moho point constraints, Rayleigh wave group velocities, and regional S and Rayleigh waveforms for a continuous map of Moho depth. The new tomographic Moho map suggests that Moho depth and Moho relief vary slightly with age within the Precambrian crust. Whether or not a positive correlation between crustal thickness and geologic age is derived from the pre-interpolation point constraints depends strongly on the selected subset of receiver functions. This implies that using only pre-interpolation point constraints (receiver functions) inadequately samples the spatial variation in geologic age. The new Moho map also reveals an anomalously deep Moho beneath the oldest core of the Amazonian Craton.},

	abstract = {Teleseismic long-period P waves recorded at the World-Wide Standard Seismograph Network station {LON} (Longmire, Washington) are shown to exhibit strong anomalous particle motion not attributable to instrument miscalibration or malfunction. In particular, a large and azimuthally smoothly varying tangential component is observed after vector rotation of horizontal P waves into the ray direction and after application of a deconvolution technique which equalizes effective source time functions and removes the instrument response. These tangential waves attain amplitudes comparable to the radial component and demonstrate wave form antisymmetry about a {NNE} azimuth. A model which contains a single high-contrast interface dipping toward the {NNE} at a depth of 15–20 km can explain most of the characteristics of the long-period P wave data, provided dips are greater than about 10° and only the interference of P and Ps generated at the interface is considered. The model breaks down for later arrivals which are presumably multiples or scattered waves. Examination of long-period S waves from several deep teleseisms shows a prominent Sp arrival 18 s before S. The timing of this phase conversion suggests an interface at about 145-km depth, and its sense of polarity suggests that the velocity contrast is from higher to lower velocities as depth decreases. This interface may correspond to the bottom of the upper mantle low-velocity zone in the area.},

A point-spread function, derived from the same ambient noise field, quantifies the smearing in space and time of the virtual source of the Green's function. By multidimensionally deconvolving the retrieved Green's function by the point-spread function, the virtual source becomes better focussed in space and time and hence the accuracy of the retrieved surface-wave Green's function may improve significantly. We illustrate this at the hand of a numerical example and discuss the advantages and limitations of this new methodology.},

	abstract = {We study the origin of the background seismic noise averaged over long time by cross correlating of the vertical component of motion, which were first normalized by 1-bit coding. We use 1 year of recording at several stations of networks located in North America, western Europe, and Tanzania. We measure normalized amplitudes of Rayleigh waves reconstructed from correlation for all available station to station paths within the networks for positive and negative correlation times to determine the seasonally averaged azimuthal distribution of normalized background energy flow ({NBEF}) through the networks. We perform the analysis for the two spectral bands corresponding to the primary (10–20 s) and secondary (5–10 s) microseism and also for the 20–40 s band. The direction of the {NBEF} for the strongest spectral peak between 5 and 10 s is found to be very stable in time with signal mostly coming from the coastline, confirming that the secondary microseism is generated by the nonlinear interaction of the ocean swell with the coast. At the same time, the {NBEF} in the band of the primary microseism (10–20 s) has a very clear seasonal variability very similar to the behavior of the long-period (20–40 s) noise. This suggests that contrary to the secondary microseism, the primary microseism is not produced by a direct effect of the swell incident on coastlines but rather by the same process that generates the longer-period noise. By simultaneously analyzing networks in California, eastern United States, Europe, and Tanzania we are able to identify main source regions of the 10–20 s noise. They are located in the northern Atlantic and in the northern Pacific during the winter and in the Indian Ocean and in southern Pacific during the summer. These distributions of sources share a great similarity with the map of average ocean wave height map obtained by {TOPEX}-Poseidon. This suggests that the seismic noise for periods larger than 10 s is clearly related to ocean wave activity in deep water. The mechanism of its generation is likely to be similar to the one proposed for larger periods, namely, infragravity ocean waves.},

	abstract = {Ambient noise tomography is a rapidly emerging field of seismological research. This paper presents the current status of ambient noise data processing as it has developed over the past several years and is intended to explain and justify this development through salient examples. The ambient noise data processing procedure divides into four principal phases: (1) single station data preparation, (2) cross-correlation and temporal stacking, (3) measurement of dispersion curves (performed with frequency–time analysis for both group and phase speeds) and (4) quality control, including error analysis and selection of the acceptable measurements. The procedures that are described herein have been designed not only to deliver reliable measurements, but to be flexible, applicable to a wide variety of observational settings, as well as being fully automated. For an automated data processing procedure, data quality control measures are particularly important to identify and reject bad measurements and compute quality assurance statistics for the accepted measurements. The principal metric on which to base a judgment of quality is stability, the robustness of the measurement to perturbations in the conditions under which it is obtained. Temporal repeatability, in particular, is a significant indicator of reliability and is elevated to a high position in our assessment, as we equate seasonal repeatability with measurement uncertainty. Proxy curves relating observed signal-to-noise ratios to average measurement uncertainties show promise to provide useful expected measurement error estimates in the absence of the long time-series needed for temporal subsetting.},

We compare waveform convergence of short duration {NCF} stacks (e.g. 2, 5, 15 and 50 d stacks) towards the long-term (365 d) {NCF} stack. We observe short duration {NCF} improvement when applying Welch's method for non–pre-processed and running normalized time-series and short duration {NCF} degradation when applied to a ‘one-bit’ normalized time-series. Surprisingly, non–pre-processed time-series provides the quickest convergence to a robust (year-long) {NCF}. Because of the simplicity of Welch's method, the improved {NCF} convergence and a minimal increase in computation, we recommend applying Welch's method for future ambient seismic field analyses. Using this approach will likely improve future {NCF} analyses, particularly for studies with limited duration recordings, high levels of intermittent local or site noise and studies attempting to evaluate temporal variations in subsurface structure.},

We describe an automated surface wave detector and extractor designed to work on weak surface wave signals across Eurasia at intermediate periods (8 s-40 s). The method is based on phase-matched filters defined by the Rayleigh wave group travel-time predictions from the broadband group velocity maps presented by {RITZWOLLER} and {LEVSHIN} (1998) and {RITZWOLLER} et al. (1998) and proceeds in three steps: Signal compression, signal extraction or cleaning, and measurement. First, the dispersed surface wave signals are compressed in time by applying an anti-dispersion or phase-matched filter defined from the group velocity maps. We refer to this as the ‘compressed signal.’ Second, the surface wave is then extracted by filtering ‘noise’ temporally isolated from the time-compressed signal. This filtered signal is then redispersed by applying the inverse of the phase-matched filter. Finally, we adaptively estimate spectral amplitude as well as group and phase velocity on the filtered signal. The method is naturally used as a detector by allowing origin time to slide along the time axis. We describe preliminary results of the application of this method to a set of nuclear explosions and earthquakes that occurred on or near the Chinese Lop Nor test site from 1992 through 1996 and one explosion on the Indian Rajasthan test site that occurred in May of 1998.},

The Mantiqueira complex represents a cordilleran-type active margin of the Archean paleocontinent, while the Juiz de Fora complex represents juvenile Paleoproterozoic material, probably developed within an oceanic setting (primitive arc or plateau?). The latter unit was probably accreted to the active margin of the paleocontinent during the latest stages of the Transamazonian Orogeny, around ca. 2.05 Ma, causing the deformation and metamorphism of the Mantiqueira complex. At this time, to the west and on the cratonic foreland, concurrent deformation of the Minas passive margin and sedimentation of the Sabará basin took place. Subsequent to the Transamazonian Orogeny, the basement associations were intruded by intraplate alkaline and basic rocks related to rifting events between ca. 1.7 and 1.3 Ga that resulted in the development of intracratonic basins. The Paleoproterozoic suture located between the Mantiqueira and Juiz de Fora Paleoproterozoic terranes probably controlled the Neoproterozoic passive margin tectonics and also the development of a major thrust surface during the Neoproterozoic/Cambrian Brasiliano convergence.},

These rocks preserve a partial record of three parageneses. The earliest assemblage (M1) grew during fabric formation in the rocks (D1) and is characterized by the mineral assemblage Pl + Bt + Sil + Kfs + Qtz. Peak metamorphic conditions (M2) are characterized by the assemblage Bt + Crd + Kfs + Pl + Grt + liq + Qtz and are inferred to have developed during D2 folding of the rocks at T = 750–800°C and P = 7 kbar. M3 reaction textures overprint the M2 assemblage and comprise symplectitic intergrowth of cordierite({II}) and quartz that formed after garnet, whereas secondary biotite formed as a result of reactions between garnet and K-feldspar. By comparing the observed modal abundances with modal contours of garnet, cordierite and quartz on the relevant pseudosection a post M2 P–T vector indicating contemporaneous cooling and decompression can be deduced. The inferred equilibrium assemblage and reaction textures are interpreted to reflect a clockwise P–T path involving heating followed by post-peak decompression and associated cooling. We infer that metamorphism occurred in response to advective heating by the abundant syn-collisional (arc-related) I-type granitoids in the region, consistent with the unusually high peak T/P ratio.},

These post-collisional, I-type, megaporphyritic and equigranular leucogranite plutons and dykes intrude high-grade metasedimentary units, orthogneisses, and migmatites within the root zone of the deeply eroded Neoproterozoic-Cambrian Ribeira belt. The ages obtained are: 511.2 ± 6.9 Ma (zircon) for the Suruí Granite; 490.3 ± 8.7 Ma (zircon) for a cross-cutting dyke of the pegmatitic facies of the Andorinha Granite from the same outcrop; 480.7 ± 6.1 Ma (zircon) for the Frades Granite; 488.7 ± 4.2 Ma (titanite) for the Nova Friburgo Granite; and 490.9 ± 9.8 Ma (zircon) for the Sana Granite. These new U-Pb ages and those compiled from the literature for post-orogenic intrusions distributed ∼400 km along the strike of the orogen (Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo States), define two separate intervals for magmatic activity, which are consistent with mineralogical and structural signatures. The magmatic intervals consist of an older Cambrian magmatic pulse occurred at ca.512 Ma (Pedra Branca, Suruí and Buarama plutons), and a younger Ordovician event at ca. 486 Ma (Mangaratiba, Favela, Andorinha, Frades, Nova Friburgo and Sana granites). The Cambrian pulse post-dates the end of the first and main collisional phase by ca. 35 m.y. It also post-dates the onset of the second collisional episode by ca. 20 m.y. The late-Ordovician magmatic pulse post-dates the end of the second collisional episode by ca. 25 m.y. In map view, the alignment of the post-collisional plutons and stocks depicts a sinuous belt running along the eroded roots of central/northern Ribeira and Araçuaí belts. This gwithranite belt probably marks the zone where preferential heating and melting of lower continental crust took place, either caused by breaking off of subducted slab, or by the extensional collapse of hot, overthickened continental crust.},

	abstract = {The Brasília Belt is a Neoproterozoic orogenic belt in central Brazil, developed between the Amazon, São Francisco-Congo and Paranapanema cratons. It consists of a thick sedimentary pile, made up of several stratigraphic units, which have been deformed and metamorphosed along the western margin of the São Francisco Craton during the Brasiliano orogenic cycle. In the western part of the belt, a large, juvenile magmatic arc is exposed (the Goiás Magmatic Arc), consisting of calc-alkaline plutonic suites as well as volcano-sedimentary sequences, ranging in age between ca. 860 and 650 Ma. Regional-scale, west-dipping thrusts and reverse faults normally mark the limits between the main stratigraphic units, and clearly indicate tectonic transport towards the east. The age of deposition and tectonic significance of the sedimentary units comprising the Brasília Belt have been a matter of continuous debate over the last three decades. In the present paper, recent provenance data based on {LA}-{ICPMS} U–Pb ages of detrital zircon grains from several of these units, are reviewed and their significance for the age of deposition of the original sediments and tectonic evolution of the Brasília Belt are discussed.

The Paranoá, Canastra and the Vazante groups, in the central part of the Belt, have detrital zircon grains with ages older than ca. 900 Ma and are interpreted as representative of the passive margin sequence deposited on the western margin of the São Francisco Craton. On the other hand, samples from the Araxá and Ibiá groups have a much younger population of Neoproterozoic zircon grains, as young as 650 Ma, and have been interpreted as syn-orogenic (fore-arc?) deposits. The Bambuí Group, exposed in the easternmost part of the belt and covering large areas of the São Francisco Craton also has young zircon grains and is interpreted, at least in part, as the foreland basin of the Brasília Belt.},

	abstract = {In the southern sector of the Southern Brasília Belt, late Neoproterozoic arc–passive margin collision resulted in juxtaposition of an arc-derived nappe (the Socorro–Guaxupé Nappe) over a stack of passive margin-derived nappes (the Andrelândia Nappe Complex) that lies on top of autochthonous basement of the São Francisco Craton. (U–Th)–Pb monazite ages are reported from the high-grade nappes of the Andrelândia Nappe Complex to better constrain the high-temperature retrograde evolution. For residual {HP} granulites from the uppermost Três Pontas–Varginha Nappe, (U–Th)–Pb ages of c. 662 and 655 Ma from low yttrium monazite inclusions in the rims of, or associated with garnet are interpreted to date the late-stage close-to-peak prograde evolution, whereas an age of c. 648 Ma from a similar low yttrium monazite inclusion is interpreted to record post-peak recrystallization with melt via factures in garnet. For the same nappe, ages of 640–631 Ma retrieved from higher yttrium areas or cores in monazite grains that occur both as inclusions in garnet and in the matrix are interpreted to record growth of monazite either by local breakdown of garnet (±older monazite) and mass exchange with a matrix melt reservoir along cracks or growth from residual melt in the matrix as it crystallized during high-pressure, close-to-isobaric cooling close to the solidus, the temperature of which, at a given pressure, varies with bulk composition of the residual granulites. (U–Th)–Pb ages in the range 620–588 Ma from lower yttrium areas in these monazite grains and from matrix-hosted patchy monazite are interpreted to date exhumation, as recorded by close-to-isothermal decompression and subsequent close-to-isobaric cooling. Older monazite ages in this group are interpreted to record late-stage interaction with melt close to the solidus whereas younger monazite ages are interpreted to record recrystallization of monazite by dissolution–reprecipitation owing to ingress of alkali fluid from the Carmo da Cachoeira Nappe beneath as fluid was released by crystallization of in-source melt at the solidus. In the underlying Carmo da Cachoeira Nappe, higher yttrium areas in monazite and one single domain monazite yield chemical ages of 619–616 Ma, which are interpreted to date growth as in-source melt crystallized close to the solidus along the high-pressure, close-to-isobaric segment of the retrograde P–T evolution. Younger (U–Th)–Pb ages of 600–595 Ma retrieved from lower yttrium areas and one single domain monazite are interpreted to record recrystallization of monazite by dissolution–reprecipitation owing to release of fluid at the solidus during exhumation of this nappe. Monazite from the Carvalhos Klippe, interpreted to be correlative with the uppermost nappe, yields a wide range of (U–Th)–Pb ages: for two zoned grains, c. 619 and c. 614 Ma from higher yttrium cores, and c. 583 and c. 595 Ma from lower yttrium rims; and, 592–580 Ma from single domain grains in one sample, and ages of c. 593 and c. 563 Ma from monazite in a second sample. Ages younger than 605 Ma are interpreted to date a fluid-induced response to the early stages of orogenic loading associated with terrane accretion in the Ribeira Belt to the southeast. The results reported here demonstrate that ages retrieved from monazite that grew close to the solidus in residual granulites from a single tectonic unit will vary from sample to sample according to differences in the solidus temperatures. Further, we show that monazite inclusions may yield ages that are younger than the host mineral and confirm the propensity of monazite to record evidence of tectonic events that are not always registered by other high-temperature mineral chronometers.},

	abstract = {Crustal structure in South America is one of the least understood among the Earth's continental areas. Variations in crustal thickness are still poorly constrained over large portions of the continent because of scarce or unevenly distributed crustal thickness estimates throughout South America. To address this scarce and inhomogeneous data cover we explore the possibility to derive crustal thickness from satellite gravity data. In this study, we utilize the combined gravity model {EIGEN-6C}, which is composed of {GOCE} and other gravity data. The Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer ({GOCE)} satellite has a much more uniform spatial resolution than any land-based gravity or seismic survey in South America. The gravity data inversion is for a simple two-layer model with fixed density contrast over the interface, the Moho. The method is not relying on point constraint data and assumes that all of the signal is related to topography of the Moho. Model quality can therefore be assessed by a comparison with point observations on crustal thickness. We show that for the stable part of the continent 90\% of our estimates are similar, within error bounds, to seismic observations. Variations occur in active orogenic zones or regions with suspected non-standard Moho density contrasts. A comparison with seismological models shows a high correlation with the most recent model. Especially in areas where continental and global models of crustal structure have limitations in terms of wave paths or point constraints the gravity based model provides a unique continuity of crustal structure providing new insights on structure and tectonics and increase our understanding of the Earth's structure underneath South America.},

Such maps have at least two purposes in monitoring the nuclear Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty ({CTBT}): (1) They can be used as data to estimate the shear velocity of the crust and uppermost mantle and topography on internal interfaces which are important in event location, and (2) they can be used to estimate surface-wave travel-time correction surfaces to be used in phase-matched filters designed to extract low signal-to-noise surface-wave packets.¶The purpose of this paper is to describe one useful path through the large number of options available in an inversion of surface-wave data. Our method appears to provide robust and reliable dispersion maps on both global and regional scales. The technique we describe has a number of features that have motivated its development and commend its use: (1) It is developed in a spherical geometry; (2) the region of inference is defined by an arbitrary simple closed curve so that the method works equally well on local, regional, or global scales; (3) spatial smoothness and model amplitude constraints can be applied simultaneously; (4) the selection of model regularization and the smoothing parameters is highly flexible which allows for the assessment of the effect of variations in these parameters; (5) the method allows for the simultaneous estimation of spatial resolution and amplitude bias of the images; and (6) the method optionally allows for the estimation of azimuthal anisotropy.¶We present examples of the application of this technique to observed surface-wave group and phase velocities globally and regionally across Eurasia and Antarctica.},

An amplitude-unbiased coherency measure is designed based on the instantaneous phase, which is used to weight the samples of an ordinary, linear stack. The result is called the phase-weighted stack ({PWS}) and is cleaned from incoherent noise. {PWS} thus permits detection of weak but coherent arrivals. The method presented can easily be extended to phase-weighted cross-correlations or be applied in the τp domain. We illustrate and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of {PWS} in comparison with other coherency measures and present examples. We further show that our non-linear stacking technique enables us to detect a weak lower-mantle P-to-S conversion from a depth of approximately 840 km on array data. Hints of an 840 km discontinuity have been reported; however, such a discontinuity is not yet established due to the lack of further evidence.},

	abstract = {Shear wave splitting in the seismic {SKS} phase provides a unique possibility to judge on deformations at depths inaccessible for direct observations. Fast S wave polarization direction in collisional belts is often parallel to the trend of the belt, although deformations of the mantle lithosphere in low-angle thrusts would lead to the fast polarization direction normal to the trend of the belt. These considerations suggested that the upper mantle in collisional belts is decoupled from the crust. However, {SKS} technique is notable by a poor depth resolution, and usually it assumes that the fast polarization direction is the same at any depth, which is hard to justify. Here, to investigate depth dependent azimuthal anisotropy in the mantle, we invert jointly P receiver functions and {SKS} particle motions at a number of seismograph stations. The technique involves azimuthal filtering of the receiver functions and provides a criterion to discriminate between the effects of azimuthal anisotropy and lateral heterogeneity of isotropic medium. A search for the optimum models is conducted with a technique similar to simulated annealing. Testing with synthetics demonstrates that this approach is robust. The results for 10 seismograph stations in the Tien Shan, the world's most active intracontinental collisional belt in Central Asia, reveal a pronounced change in the patterns of azimuthal anisotropy at a depth around 100 km. In the mantle lithosphere (at depths less than 100 km), anisotropy is relatively weak and fast wave polarization direction varies laterally in a broad range. This layer is not necessarily decoupled from the crust: its anisotropy can be a combined effect of present day thrusting and of deformations of the geologic past. In the lower layer (asthenosphere) the average azimuth of fast wave polarization is close to the trend of the belt, whereas magnitude of S wave anisotropy is stable and large (between 5 and 6 per cent). This anisotropy is a likely result of recent uniaxial shortening at right angle to the trend of the belt. At some stations the data require anisotropy in the crust. There is no evidence for anisotropy at depths exceeding 150–250 km.},

	abstract = {The Neoproterozoic arc related rocks of the central segment of the Ribeira belt crop out at the Oriental Terrane that is subdivided into three thrust sheets verging northwestern ward, each of them with subduction related rocks. The recently discovered Serra da Bolívia complex crops out at the Cambuci domain that represents the lowermost thrust sheet of the Oriental terrane. The unit comprises orthogneisses of varied compositions, ranging from basic to acid rocks. Hornblende bearing coarse grained orthogneisses, with granodiorite to quartz-diorite compositions, is the most common association in the complex; followed by quartz poor rocks such as monzo-gabbros, monzodiorites, monzonites and syenites. Coarse grained gabbros (norites) and leucogabbros occur as lenses inside the orthogneisses.

New geological, geochemical and geochronological data for recently described arc-related orthogneisses of the Serra da Bolívia complex is presented. The connection with other arc-related rocks of the Araçuaí and southern Ribeira belt in the context of West Gondwana reconstructions is also explored.

Chemical data indicates at least three groups of sub-alkaline rocks and one group of alkaline to transitional character ({SH}). Among the sub-alkaline groups three calc-alkaline groups ({CA}1, {CA}2 and {CA}3) with progressive enrichment in Alkalis are discriminated. Tectonic discriminate diagrams suggest that the calc-alkaline groups display compositions compatible with arc settings, while the shoshonite group, with more evolved compositions indicates progressive maturity during arc development. Few basic rocks indicate {CAB} or {IAT} filiations.

Obtained U–Pb ages for tonalites and gabbros yielded values between ca. 596 and 591 Ma, but an older {TIMS} age pointed to ca. 620 Ma. The youngest monzonite orthogneiss yielded ca. 574 Ma, similar to the metamorphic ages previously described for the Ribeira belt. Sm-Nd data resulted on Tdm model ages of ca. 1.72 Ga and 2.04 Ga, except for three samples, which display Mesoproterozoic model ages. The initial ɛNd, calculated for 605 Ma, which is the average age for the complex are between −8 and −12.

Regional correlations suggest that the Serra da Bolivia Complex represents the inner cordilleran magmatic arc of the Ribeira belt that continues northward to the Galiléia arc (G1 association of the Araçuaí belt), and southwards to the Socorro arc at the interference zone of the Brasília belt. Combined U–Pb data indicate the development of a cordilleran arc between ca. 650 and 590 Ma. Youngest syenitic to monzonitic bodies are coeval with the metamorphic episode and intrude the older rocks of the arc. The other two previously described arc related complexes, Rio Negro and Serra da Prata arcs are located easternmost at the belt and display contrasting more juvenile signatures and older ages reaching ca. 840 M.

Looking to the West Gondwana scenario, during Tonian to Cryogenian time, subduction all around older and stables plates resulted on the generation of large volumes of arc-related rocks. In most of the belts, only the plutonic zones of the magmatic arcs are exposed. Based on time span of rock crystallization of all the arc related rocks of the Ribeira belt, the subduction period lasted at least 240 million years. Even though subduction was breaking down into three individual zones, the tectonic scenario suggests oceanic plate consumption in a protracted evolution. The initial phases of most magmatic arcs are represented by more primitive and juvenile rocks, but at the end of the subduction period, at the Ediacaran, a more cordilleran setting was achieved. By the end of the Ediacaran period and the beginning of Cambrian, all the pieces were attached together in several diachronic collisions leading to the final amalgamation of West Gondwana.},

	abstract = {The crustal structure of the south-eastern Brazilian continental shelf has been investigated through the dispersion curves of seismic surface waves obtained at Brazilian seismological station {RDJ}. A set of eight continental-shelf models has been tried, to obtain the best shear-wave velocity structure. The inversion results suggest a sedimentary structure divided into two layers with shear-wave velocities of 1.36 ± 0.10 km s−1 and 1.58 ± 0.10 km s−1, respectively. This is in agreement with preliminary results found by the Brazilian Petroleum Company Petrobras using seismic data in the area (O. R. Sá \& L. P. A. Gamboa, private communication, 1994). The intermediate crustal layer has a shear-wave velocity (3.26 - 0.10 km s−1 typical of basement. An anomalous shear-wave velocity of 3.98 ± 0.10 km s−1 has been determined for the lower crust. This suggests the existence of a transitional layer between lower crust and upper mantle, similar to that observed in both Mediterranean and Canadian passive continental margins. It was not possible to define precisely the crust-mantle transition, but an analysis of the inversion results has shown that the Moho boundary is at around 40 ± 5 km depth.},

	abstract = {The Rayleigh wave phase and group velocities in the period range of 24–39 sec, obtained from two earthquakes which occurred in northeastern brazil and which were recorded by the Brazilian seismological station {RDJ} (Rio de Janeiro), have been used to study crustal and upper mantle structures of the Brazilian coastal region. Three crustal and upper mantle models have been tried out to explain crustal and upper mantle structures of the region. The upper crust has not been resolved, due basically to the narrow period range of the phase and group velocities data. The phase velocity inversions have exhibited good resolutions for both lower crust and upper mantle, with shear wave velocities characteristic of these regions. The group velocity data inversions for these models have showed good results only for the lower crust. The shear wave velocities of the lower crust (3.86 and 3.89 km/sec), obtained with phase velocity inversions, are similar to that (β=3.89 km/sec) found {byHwang} (1985) to the eastern South American region, while group velocity inversions have presented shear velocity (β=3.75 km/sec) similar to that (β=3.78 km/sec) found {byLazcano} (1972) to the Brazilian shield. It was not possible to define sharply the crust-mantle transition, but an analysis of the phase and group velocity inversions results has indicated that the total thickness of the crust should be between 30 and 39 km. The crustal and upper mantle model, obtained with phase velocity inversion, can be used as a preliminary model for the Brazilian coast.},
