	abstract = {We estimate lithospheric velocity structure for the Arabian Shield by jointly modeling receiver functions and fundamental-mode group velocities from events recorded by the 1995–1997 Saudi Arabian Portable Broadband Deployment. Receiver functions are primarily sensitive to shear-wave velocity contrasts and vertical travel times, and surface-wave dispersion measurements are sensitive to vertical shear-wave velocity averages, so that their combination bridge resolution gaps associated with each individual data set. Our resulting models correlate well with the observed surface geology; the Asir terrane to the West consists of a 10-km-thick upper crust of 3.3 km/s overlying a lower crust of 3.7–3.8 km/s; in the Afif terrane to the East, the upper crust is 20 km thick and has an average velocity of 3.6 km/s, and the lower crust is about 3.8 km/s; separating the terranes, the Nabitah mobile belt is made of a gradational upper crust up to 3.6 km/s at 15 km overlying an also gradational lower crust up to 4.0 km/s. The crust–mantle transition is found to be sharp in terranes of continental affinity (east) and gradual in terranes of oceanic affinity (west). The upper mantle shear velocities range from 4.3 to 4.6 km/s. Temperatures around 1000 °C are obtained from our velocity models for a thin upper mantle lid observed beneath station {TAIF}, and suggest that the lithosphere could be as thin as 50–60 km under this station.},

	abstract = {Seismic techniques provide the highest-resolution measurements of the structure of the crust and have been conducted on a worldwide basis. We summarize the structure of the continental crust based on the results of seismic refraction profiles and infer crustal composition as a function of depth by comparing these results with high-pressure laboratory measurements of seismic velocity for a wide range of rocks that are commonly found in the crust. The thickness and velocity structure of the crust are well correlated with tectonic province, with extended crust showing an average thickness of 30.5 km and orogens an average of 46.3 km. Shields and platforms have an average crustal thickness nearly equal to the global average. We have corrected for the nonuniform geographical distribution of seismic refraction profiles by estimating the global area of each major crustal type. The weighted average crustal thickness based on these values is 41.1 km. This value is 10\% to 20\% greater than previous estimates which underrepresented shields, platforms, and orogens. The average compressional wave velocity of the crust is 6.45 km/s, and the average velocity of the uppermost mantle (Pn velocity) is 8.09 km/s. We summarize the velocity structure of the crust at 5-km depth intervals, both in the form of histograms and as an average velocity-depth curve, and compare these determinations with new measurements of compressional wave velocities and densities of over 3000 igneous and metamorphic rock cores made to confining pressures of 1 {GPa}. On the basis of petrographic studies and chemical analyses, the rocks have been classified into 29 groups. Average velocities, densities, and standard deviations are presented for each group at 5-km depth intervals to crustal depths of 50 km along three different geotherms. This allows us to develop a model for the composition of the continental crust. Velocities in the upper continental crust are matched by velocities of a large number of lithologies, including many low-grade metamorphic rocks and relatively silicic gneisses of amphibolite facies grade. In midcrustal regions, velocity gradients appear to originate from an increase in metamorphic grade, as well as a decrease in silica content. Tonalitic gneiss, granitic gneiss, and amphibolite are abundant midcrustal lithologies. Anisotropy due to preferred mineral orientation is likely to be significant in upper and midcrustal regions. The bulk of the lower continental crust is chemically equivalent to gabbro, with velocities in agreement with laboratory measurements of mafic granulite. Garnet becomes increasingly abundant with depth, and mafic garnet granulite is the dominant rock type immediately above the Mohorovicic discontinuity. Average compressional wave velocities of common crustal rock types show excellent correlations with density. The mean crustal density calculated from our model is 2830 kg/m3, and the average {SiO}2 content is 61.8\%.},

A time-domain inversion of the radial receiver function is used to determine the structure assuming a crustal model parameterized by flat-lying, homogeneous layers. The general features of the inversion results are: a complex shallow crust, velocities less than 6 km/s in the upper crust, a high velocity (6.9-7.5 km/s) lower crust, and a Moho that varies between 47 and 57 km depth. These results compare favorably with a composite velocity model from Deep Seismic Sounding data, but show lower velocities in the upper crust, and higher velocities in the lower crust. The results indicate that the crust in this region is relatively uniform, however the nature and depth of the Moho changes significantly across the region. The receiver function inversion structure for the Kazakh sites is similar to a published receiver function structure for a site on the Canadian Shield.},

We present the results of more than 235 waveform inversions for one-dimensional velocity structures that indicate that the primary sensitivity of a receiver function is to high wavenumber velocity changes, and a depth-velocity product, not simply velocity. The range of slownesses in a typical receiver function study does not appear to be broad enough to remove the depth-velocity ambiguity; the inclusion of a priori information is necessary.

The detailed broadband receiver functions are obtained by stacking source-equalized horizontal components of teleseismic P waveforms. The resulting receiver functions are most sensitive to the shear velocity structure near the station. A time domain inversion routine utilizes the radial receiver function to determine this structure assuming a crustal model parameterized by many thin, flat-lying, homogeneous layers. Lateral changes in structure are identified by examining azimuthal variations in the vertical structure. The results reveal significant rapid lateral changes in the midcrustal structure beneath the station that are interpreted in relation to the origin of the East Continent Gravity High located northeast of {RSCP}. The results from events arriving from the northeast show a high-velocity midcrustal layer not present in results from the southeast azimuth. This velocity structure can be shown to support the idea that this feature is part of a Keweenawan rift system. Another interesting feature of the derived velocity models is the indication that the crust-mantle boundary beneath the Cumberland Plateau is a thick, probably laminated transition zone between the depths of 40 and 55 km, a result consistent with interpretations of early refraction work in the area.},

	abstract = {We present a new global model for the Earth's crust based on seismic refraction data published in the period 1948–1995 and a detailed compilation of ice and sediment thickness. An extensive compilation of seismic refraction measurements has been used to determine the crustal structure on continents and their margins. Oceanic crust is modeled with both a standard model for normal oceanic crust, and variants for nonstandard regions, such as oceanic plateaus. Our model ({CRUST} 5.1) consists of 2592 5° × 5° tiles in which the crust and uppermost mantle are described by eight layers: (1) ice, (2) water, (3) soft sediments, (4) hard sediments, (5) crystalline upper, (6) middle, (7) lower crust, and (8) uppermost mantle. Topography and bathymetry are adopted from a standard database ({ETOPO}-5). Compressional wave velocity in each layer is based on field measurements, and shear wave velocity and density are estimated using recently published empirical Vp- Vs and Vp-density relationships. The crustal model differs from previous models in that (1) the thickness and seismic/density structure of sedimentary basins is accounted for more completely, (2) the velocity structure of unmeasured regions is estimated using statistical averages that are based on a significantly larger database of crustal structure, (3) the compressional wave, shear wave, and density structure have been explicitly specified using newly available constraints from field and laboratory studies. Thus this global crustal model is based on substantially more data than previous models and differs from them in many important respects. A new map of the thickness of the Earth's crust is presented, and we illustrate the application of this model by using it to provide the crustal correction for surface wave phase velocity maps. Love waves at 40 s are dominantly sensitive to crustal structure, and there is a very close correspondence between observed phase velocities at this period and those predicted by {CRUST} 5.1. We find that the application of crustal corrections to long-period (167 s) Rayleigh waves significantly increases the variance in the phase velocity maps and strengthens the upper mantle velocity anomalies beneath stable continental regions. A simple calculation of crustal isostacy indicates significant lateral variations in upper mantle density. The model {CRUST} 5.1 provides a complete description of the physical properties of the Earth's crust at a scale of 5° × 5° and can be used for a wide range of seismological and nonseismological problems.},

	abstract = {The Brazilian Lithosphere Seismic Project (BLSP, a joint project by University of São Paulo and Carnegie Institution, 1992– 1999) operated more than 20 temporary broadband stations in the southeastern Brazilian shield. The area, a transect 1000 km long and 300 km wide, covers different geological provinces: the Precambrian São Francisco craton, the adjacent Brasiliano(700 –500 Ma) fold belts, and the Paraná basin of Paleozoic origin. Crustal thicknesses were estimated for 23 sites using receiver functions. For each station, receiver functions were stacked for different sets of earthquakes according to azimuth and distance. The P-to-S Moho converted phase was clearly identified at most sites. Crustal thicknesses were estimated using an average crustal P wave velocity of 6.5 km/s. Poisson’s ratio of 0.23 (Vp/Vs = 1.70) was used for the São Francisco craton and adjacent fold belt (based on travel times from small, local earthquakes) and 0.25 was used for the Paraná basin and coastal belt. Crustal thicknesses ranged from 35 – 47 km. Although there is a clear inverse correlation between topography and Bouguer gravity anomalies in the study area, Moho depths show the opposite pattern from that expected: areas of low topography and less negative Bouguer anomalies, such as the Paraná basin, have thicker crust (40 –47 km) compared with the high elevation areas of the craton and fold belt (37 – 43 km). Two hypothesis are proposed to explain the data: (1) A lower density, by 30 –40 kg/m 3 , in the lithospheric mantle under the Archean block of the São Francisco craton relative to the Proterozoic lithosphere is responsible for maintaining the high elevations in the plateau area. Relatively low density and high P wave velocity are compatible with a depleted (low FeO) composition for the Archean lithosphere. (2) Alternatively, if the density contrasts between Archean and Proterozoic lithospheres are smaller than the values above, then the crust beneath the Paraná basin must be more dense than that of the craton. Higher crustal density and high Poisson’s ratio would be consistent with magmatic underplating in the lower crust beneath the Paraná basin, as inferred from other studies.},

	abstract = {The mountains across southern Norway and other margins of the North Atlantic Ocean appear conspicuously high in the absence of recent convergent tectonics. We investigate this phenomenon with receiver functions calculated for seismometers deployed across southern Fennoscandia. These are used to constrain the structure and seismic properties of the lithosphere and primarily to measure the thickness and infer the bulk composition of the crust. Such parameters are key to understanding crustal isostasy and assessing its role, or lack thereof, in supporting the observed elevations. Our study focuses on the southern Scandes mountain range that has an average elevation > 1.0 km above mean sea level. The crust–mantle boundary (Moho) is ubiquitously imaged, and we occasionally observe structures that may represent the base of the continental lithosphere or other thermal, chemical, or viscous boundaries in the upper mantle. The Moho resides at ∼ 25–30 km depth below mean sea level in southeastern coastal Norway and parts of Denmark, ∼ 35–45 km across the southern Scandes, and ∼ 50–60 km near the
Norwegian–Swedish border. That section of thickest crust coincides with much of the Transscandinavian Igneous Belt and often exhibits a diffuse conversion at the Moho, which probably results from the presence of a high wave speed, mafic lower crust across inner Fennoscandia. A zone of thinned crust ( < 35 km) underlies the Oslo Graben. Crustal Vp/Vs ratio measurements show trends that generally correlate with Moho depth; relatively high Vp/Vs occurs near the coast and areas affected by post-Caledonide rifting and lower Vp/Vs appears in older, unrifted crust across the southern Scandes. Our results indicate that most of the observed surface elevation in the southern Scandes is supported by an
Airy-like crustal root and potentially thin mantle lithosphere. To the east, where thicker crust and mantle lithosphere underlie low elevations, the presence of dense mafic lower crust fits a Pratt-like model for isostatic compensation. Because the Scandes mountains occupy the location of the ancient Caledonian orogeny, which created presumably much thicker crust and lithosphere by ca. 400 Ma, much of the dense lower crust or mantle lithosphere that is expected to form beneath large mountain belts must have been removed sometime afterwards to instill the current lithospheric architecture that underlies
the region.},

The Borborema Province represents the western portion of a larger Neoproterozoic mobile belt that resulted from the assembly of Gondwanaland, and that split from the African continent during Mesozoic times. The evolution of the Province after continental breakup was marked by episodes of diffuse intraplate magmatism, perhaps leading to uplift of the Borborema Plateau in the Cenozoic. A number of geodynamic models have been proposed to explain coeval Cenozoic magmatism and uplift in the Province, which invoke either thermal anomalies under the Plateau and related mantle upwellings, channeling along lithospheric thin spots from a distant mantle plume, and small-scale convection at the continental edge. Alternatively, plateau uplift might have resulted from thickening of the crust after depth-dependent stretching of the continental lithosphere in the Mesozoic. Most of the models imply mafic underplating of the Plateau's crust in order to fully explain its elevated topography, but the volume of such mafic underplate varies among them. Our results show that: (i) the crust is 32–40 km thick under the Borborema Plateau, (ii) the crust is generally thinner – about 30–33 km – under the lower topographies surrounding the Plateau, and (iii) {VP}/{VS} ratios are in the 1.68–1.80 range for both regions of higher and lower topography. No apparent correlation is observed between {VP}/{VS} ratio and crustal thickness. Our results suggest that compositional differences between thick and thin crust across the Borborema Province are minimal, and that models of plateau uplift involving a small volume of mafic underplate provide a more plausible explanation for the observed topography of the Borborema Plateau.},

The crustal Poisson ratio can be determined from the joint analysis of the travel times of waves converted at the Moho and of crustal multiples reflected at the top of the Moho. We have analyzed the records of the permanent stations installed on the Australian continent, complemented by the data of the \{SKIPPY\} experiment. The results reveal substantial variations in the Poisson ratio in the different tectonic units. For the Proterozoic crust, an increase of the Poisson ratio with increasing crustal thickness is systematically observed while for the Phanerozoic crust, the Poisson ratio tends to decrease for increasing crustal thicknesses. These observations are in remarkable agreement with the results of the deep seismic soundings that were performed in the former Soviet Union. The variations observed in the Proterozoic provinces can perhaps be explained by underplating of mafic materials at the base of the crust. "

anorthite. Fe substitution for Mg in pyroxene and olivine also increases Poisson's ratio. Plotting rock compressional wave velocities versus Poisson's ratios reveals a triangular distribution bounded by quartzite with low compressional wave velocity and low Poisson's ratio, dunite with high compressional wave velocity and intermediate Poisson's ratio, and serpentinite with low compressional wave velocity and high Poisson's ratio. For common plutonic igneous rocks, there is a clear trend relating Poisson's ratio to composition, in which Poisson's ratio for granitic rocks increases from 0.24 to 0.29 as composition changes to gabbro and then decreases with decreasing plagioclase and increasing olivine contents to 0.25 in dunite. Changes in Poisson's ratio with progressive metamorphism of mafic and pelitic rocks correlate reasonably well with mineral reactions. There is no simple correlation between Poisson's ratio and felsic and mafic rock compositions; however, a linear correlation of increasing Poisson's ratio with decreasing {SiO}2 content is observed for rocks with 55 to 75 wt \% {SiO}2. Average Poisson's ratios for continental and oceanic crusts are estimated to be 0.265 and 0.30, respectively.},

The crust study using the Receiver Function is performed with teleseismic P-waves that reaches the interface, under the station, with an almost vertical angle. The Receiver Function is obtained through the deconvolution of the horizontal component from the vertical one. The synthetic seismogram of the Receiver Function has a higher peak of direct P-waves, followed by minor peaks of Psc waves, where P converted into S in the upper-lower crust limit and multiple reflections. It was used the phase weighted slant-stacked method for the estimate of upper-crustal thickness and mb ratio. The best estimates are correctly stacked. The Normal Moveout correction for the Psc phase was used for the upper-crust thickness, simulating a vertical incidence. A total of 8 stations on the Borborema Province in the Brazilian Northeast was analyzed. The results show that there is an upper-lower crust limit in all the analyzed signs. The thickness estimates showed two thickness regions. The first one in Coast Region, that indicates of the thin upper-crust and the second, continental regions characterized by uniform thicker upper-crust.

The method presented can easily be extended to phase-weighted cross-correlations or be applied in the τp domain. We illustrate and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of {PWS} in comparison with other coherency measures and present examples.

Thin, 30 km thick, crust is present in the northern portion of Nevada and Utah despite elevations similar to those farther south. Crustal thickness across the Colorado Plateau can be characterized as a broad transitional region between the thin crust of Basin and Range to the thicker crust of the Rocky Mountains. The impedance contrast across the Mohorovicic discontinuity decreases below the Colorado Plateau, as converted arrivals recorded in this region appear weak compared to surrounding areas. Variations in {VP}/{VS} across the region indicate higher values along the western boundary of the Basin and Range, in the Rocky Mountains, and in the western Great Plains. We are not able to characterize {VP}/{VS} in the Colorado Plateau. We find that crustal thickness does not closely correlate with surface topography within each region or across the region as a whole. Differences in crustal thickness in each tectonic province indicate the need for a mantle component to support the high elevations across the western United States.},

	abstract = {We have investigated the crustal architecture of the Borborema Province of {NE} Brazil by constructing common conversion point ({CCP}) receiver function stacks from teleseismic P-waveforms recorded at 64 seismic stations in the region. The Borborema Province represents the western portion of a larger Neoproterozoic mobile belt that experienced extension in the Mesozoic, leading to the formation of a number of intra-continental rift basins and, eventually, continental breakup. After continental breakup, episodes of uplift in the Province — perhaps related to coeval episodes of Cenozoic volcanism — helped shape the high topographies of the Borborema Plateau. Our receiver function {CCP} stacks image clear P-to-S conversions at the crust–mantle boundary and confirm independent evidence for a 36–38 km thick crust under the southern portion of the Plateau and a thinner 30–32 km thick crust in the surrounding regions, including the northern Plateau. The cross-sections also reveal the presence of an intra-crustal discontinuity at 9–18 km depth under the regions of thin crust that fades away under the thick southern Plateau. We argue that the thin crust in the Borborema Province is the result of Mesozoic crustal stretching and that the intra-crustal discontinuity represents a low-angle detachment zone that helped accommodate extension in the crust. The thick crust under the southern Plateau would then represent a rheologically stronger portion of the Borborema Province that resisted deformation by Mesozoic extension, while the thin crust under the northern Plateau would be a portion of formerly depressed thin crust that was uplifted during the Cenozoic.},

Crustal thicknesses derived from modelling gravity anomalies commonly depend on assumptions, such as constant density contrast across the Moho interface, which are not always easily verifiable and were considered only along the continental shelf to fill large gaps in the seismic data. Our compilation shows that the crust in the stable continental area onshore has an average thickness of 39 ± 5 km (1-σ deviation) and that no clear difference can be observed between low altitude, intracratonic sedimentary basins, {NeoProterozoic} foldbelts (except for the Borborema Province), and cratonic areas. The thinnest crust is found in the Borborema Province of {NE} Brazil (30–35 km) and along a narrow belt within Tocantins Province (∼35 km), roughly parallel to the Eastern border of the Amazon craton, while the thickest crust is found in the Amazon and São Francisco cratons (41 ± 4 km), and the Paraná Basin (42 ± 4 km). Both the Ponta Grossa and the Rio Grande Arches are areas of thinned crust, and the western border of the Brazilian platform, near the sub-Andean region, seems to be characterized by a crustal thickness of less than 40 km.

We consider point crustal thicknesses from seismic refraction experiments, receiver function analyses, and surface-wave dispersion. Estimates of crustal thickness derived from gravity anomalies were only included along the continental shelf and in some areas of the Andes to fill large gaps in seismic coverage. Two crustal models were developed: A) by simple interpolation of the point estimates, and B) our preferred model, based on the same point estimates, interpolated with surface-wave tomography. Despite gaps in continental coverage, both models reveal interesting crustal thickness variations. In the Andean range, the crust reaches 75 km in Southern Peru and the Bolivian Altiplano, while crustal thicknesses seem to be close to the global continental average ({\textasciitilde} 40 km) in Ecuador and southern Colombia (despite high elevations), and along the southern Andes of Chile–Argentina (elevation lower than 2000 m). In the stable continental platform the average thickness is 38 ± 5 km (1-st. deviation) and no systematic differences are observed among Archean–Paleoproterozoic cratons, {NeoProterozoic} fold belts, and low-altitude intracratonic sedimentary basins. An exception is the Borborema Province ({NE} Brazil) with crust {\textasciitilde} 30–35 km thick. Narrow belts surrounding the cratons are suggested in central Brazil, parallel to the eastern and southern border of the Amazon craton, and possibly along the {TransBrasiliano} Lineament continuing into the Chaco basin, where crust thinner than 35 km is observed. In the sub-Andean region, between the mid-plate cratons and the Andean cordillera, the crust tends to be thinner ({\textasciitilde} 35 km) than the average crust in the stable platform, a feature possibly inherited from the old pre-Cambrian history of the continent.

	abstract = {Crustal structure in South America is one of the least understood among the Earth's continental areas. Variations in crustal thickness are still poorly constrained over large portions of the continent because of scarce or unevenly distributed crustal thickness estimates throughout South America. To address this scarce and inhomogeneous data cover we explore the possibility to derive crustal thickness from satellite gravity data. In this study, we utilize the combined gravity model {EIGEN}-6C, which is composed of {GOCE} and other gravity data. The Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer ({GOCE}) satellite has a much more uniform spatial resolution than any land-based gravity or seismic survey in South America. The gravity data inversion is for a simple two-layer model with fixed density contrast over the interface, the Moho. The method is not relying on point constraint data and assumes that all of the signal is related to topography of the Moho. Model quality can therefore be assessed by a comparison with point observations on crustal thickness. We show that for the stable part of the continent 90\% of our estimates are similar, within error bounds, to seismic observations. Variations occur in active orogenic zones or regions with suspected non-standard Moho density contrasts. A comparison with seismological models shows a high correlation with the most recent model. Especially in areas where continental and global models of crustal structure have limitations in terms of wave paths or point constraints the gravity based model provides a unique continuity of crustal structure providing new insights on structure and tectonics and increase our understanding of the Earth's structure underneath South America.},

Receiver functions are primarily sensitive to shear wave velocity contrasts and vertical traveltimes, and surface wave dispersion measurements are sensitive to vertical shear wave velocity averages. Their combination may bridge resolution gaps associated with each individual data set. We formulate a linearized shear velocity inversion that is solved using a damped least-squares scheme that incorporates a priori smoothness constraints for velocities in adjacent layers. The data sets are equalized for the number of data points and physical units in the inversion process. The combination of information produces a relatively simple model with a minimal number of sharp velocity contrasts. We illustrate the approach using noise-free and realistic noise simulations and conclude with an inversion of observations from the Saudi Arabian Shield. Inversion results for station {SODA}, located in the Arabian Shield, include a crust with a sharp gradient near the surface (shear velocity changing from 1.8 to 3.5 km s−1 in 3 km) underlain by a 5-km-thick layer with a shear velocity of 3.5 km s−1 and a 27-km-thick layer with a shear velocity of 3.8 km s−1, and an upper mantle with an average shear velocity of 4.7 km s−1. The crust–mantle transition has a significant gradient, with velocity values varying from 3.8 to 4.7 km s−1 between 35 and 40 km depth.

We used ∼5700 Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion curves and 1537 regional wave trains with paths principally passing through the South American continent. The joint inversion of this data set provided a new three-dimensional (3-D) upper mantle S velocity model and a Moho depth model for South America, which fits both the group velocity and regional waveform data sets well. New features of the final three-dimensional (3-D) S velocity and Moho depth model correlate well with known geotectonic units on a regional scale. The Moho depth ranges from 30 km in the central Chaco basin to 42 km beneath the Amazonian craton and 45–70 km beneath the orogenic Andean belt. The imaged S velocity indicates an average lithosphere thickness of around 160 km for the Amazonian craton. High velocities are imaged beneath the Amazon and part of the Paraná and Parnaíba basins down to about 150 km. Low to very low velocities are imaged beneath the central Andes and the Chaco, Pantanal, and northwestern Paraná basins.},

The study area can be described as a typical Paleozoic intracratonic basin that hosts one of the largest Large Igneous Province of the world and makes a unique setting for investigating models of basin subsidence and their interaction with mantle plumes. Our study consists of (1) an analysis of the Moho interaction phases in the receiver functions to obtain the thickness and bulk Vp/Vs ratio of the basin`s underlying crust and (2) a joint inversion with Rayleigh-wave dispersion velocities from an independent tomographic study to delineate the detailed S-wave velocity variation with depth. The results of our analysis reveal that Moho depths and bulk Vp/Vs ratios (including sediments) vary between 41 and 48 km and between 1.70 and 1.76, respectively, with the largest values roughly coinciding with the basin`s axis, and that S-wave velocities in the lower crust are generally below 3.8 km/s. Select sites within the basin, however, show lower crustal S-wave velocities slightly above 3.9 km/s suggestive of underplated mafic material. We show that these observations are consistent with a fragmented cratonic root under the Parana basin that defined a zone of weakness for the initial Paleozoic subsidence of the basin and which allowed localized mafic underplating of the crust along the suture zones by Cenozoic magmatism.},

	abstract = {The number of broadband three-component seismic stations in southern California has more than tripled recently. In this study we use the teleseismic receiver function technique to determine the crustal thicknesses and Vp/Vs ratios for these stations and map out the lateral variation of Moho depth under southern California. It is shown that a receiver function can provide a very good “point” measurement of crustal thickness under a broadband station and is not sensitive to crustal P velocity. However, the crustal thickness estimated only from the delay time of the Moho P-to-S converted phase trades off strongly with the crustal Vp/Vs ratio. The ambiguity can be reduced significantly by incorporating the later multiple converted phases, namely, the {PpPs} and {PpSs}+{PsPs}. We propose a stacking algorithm which sums the amplitudes of receiver function at the predicted arrival times of these phases by different crustal thicknesses H and Vp/Vs ratios. This transforms the time domain receiver functions directly into the H-Vp/Vs domain without need to identify these phases and to pick their arrival times. The best estimations of crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratio are found when the three phases are stacked coherently. By stacking receiver functions from different distances and directions, effects of lateral structural variation are suppressed, and an average crustal model is obtained. Applying this technique to 84 digital broadband stations in southern California reveals that the Moho depth is 29 km on average and varies from 21 to 37 km. Deeper Mohos are found under the eastern Transverse Range, the Peninsular Range, and the Sierra Nevada Range. The central Transverse Range, however, does not have a crustal root. Thin crusts exist in the Inner California Borderland (21–22 km) and the Salton Trough (22 km). The Moho is relatively flat at the average depth in the western and central Mojave Desert and becomes shallower to the east under the Eastern California Shear Zone ({ECSZ}). Southern California crust has an average Vp/Vs ratio of 1.78, with higher ratios of 1.8 to 1.85 in the mountain ranges with Mesozoic basement and lower ratios in the Mojave Block except for the {ECSZ}, where the ratio increases.},

	abstract = {Teleseismic long-period P waves recorded at the World-Wide Standard Seismograph Network station {LON} (Longmire, Washington) are shown to exhibit strong anomalous particle motion not attributable to instrument miscalibration or malfunction. In particular, a large and azimuthally smoothly varying tangential component is observed after vector rotation of horizontal P waves into the ray direction and after application of a deconvolution technique which equalizes effective source time functions and removes the instrument response. These tangential waves attain amplitudes comparable to the radial component and demonstrate wave form antisymmetry about a {NNE} azimuth. A model which contains a single high-contrast interface dipping toward the {NNE} at a depth of 15–20 km can explain most of the characteristics of the long-period P wave data, provided dips are greater than about 10° and only the interference of P and Ps generated at the interface is considered. The model breaks down for later arrivals which are presumably multiples or scattered waves. Examination of long-period S waves from several deep teleseisms shows a prominent Sp arrival 18 s before S. The timing of this phase conversion suggests an interface at about 145-km depth, and its sense of polarity suggests that the velocity contrast is from higher to lower velocities as depth decreases. This interface may correspond to the bottom of the upper mantle low-velocity zone in the area.},

The {\textasciitilde}3 km thick, Phanerozoic sedimentary section overlies a pronounced, planar, regional unconformity that crosses three Precambrian blocks with differing seismic facies: the Amazonian/Araguaia block, the Parnaíba block, and the Borborema block. The blocks are separated by steep crustal-scale boundaries across which seismic facies change abruptly. In the west, the ophiolitic metasedimentary rocks of the Araguaia Group overlie the Amazonian craton. Both craton and metasediments terminate eastward against a steep, east dipping fault zone defining the Amazonian/Araguaia block and Parnaíba block boundary. Reactivation of this Neoproterozoic margin in the Late Triassic and Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous, folded and elevated basement and basin over 2 km. A second crustal boundary defines the eastern margin of the Parnaíba block with the Neoproterozoic Borborema block. This boundary is interpreted as the extension of the Transbrasiliano shear zone. These data demonstrate that the basement of the Parnaíba basin was formed during Brasiliano orogenesis by west directed collision-related thrusting, succeeded by lateral accretion along steep, crustal-scale boundaries. After formation of a post-Brasiliano peneplain, the Parnaíba basin developed seamlessly across three very different crustal blocks and appears to have been significantly larger than its present outline. No extensive underlying rift system is evident suggesting that basement structure had little to do with basin formation, but that episodic reactivation of the boundary zones and basement fabric has controlled the structuring and preservation of the basin.},

Brazil underlain by Precambrian crystalline basement, which comprises a
complex lithostructural and tectonic framework formed during the
Neoproterozoic-Eopaleozoic Brasiliano-Pan African orogenic
collage. A sag basin up to 3.5 km thick and 1000 km long formed after
the collage. The lithologic composition, structure, and role in the
basin evolution of the underlying basement are the focus of this study.
Airborne gravity and magnetic data were modeled to reveal the general
crustal structure underneath the Parnaíba Basin. Results indicate
that gravity and magnetic signatures delineate the main boundaries and
structural trends of three cratonic areas and surrounding Neoproterozoic
fold belts in the basement. Triangular-shaped basement inliers are
geophysically defined in the central region of this continental-scale
Neoproterozoic convergence zone. A 3-D gravity inversion constrained by
seismological data reveals that basement inliers exhibit a 36-40.5
km deep crustal root, with borders defined by a high-density and thinner
crust. Forward modeling of gravity and magnetic data indicates that
lateral boundaries between crustal units are limited by Brasiliano shear
zones, representing lithospheric sutures of the Amazonian and São
Francisco Cratons, Tocantins Province and Parnaíba Block. In
addition, coincident residual gravity, residual magnetic, and
pseudo-gravity lows indicate two complex systems of Eopaleozoic rifts
related to the initial phase of the sag deposition, which follow
basement trends in several directions.},

	abstract = {Neoproterozoic geologic and geotectonic processes were of utmost importance in forming and structuring the basement framework of the South-American platform. Two large domains with distinct evolutionary histories are identified with respect to the Neoproterozoic era: the northwest-west (Amazonian craton and surroundings) and the central-southeast (the extra-Amazonian domain).

In the first domain, Neoproterozoic events occurred only locally and were of secondary significance, and the geologic events, processes, and structures of the pre-Neoproterozoic (and syn-Brasiliano) cratonic block were much more influential. In the second, the extra-Amazonian domain, the final evolution, structures and forms are assigned to events related to the development of a complex net of Neoproterozoic mobile belts. These in turn resulted in strong reworking of the older pre-Neoproterozoic basement. In this domain, four distinct structural provinces circumscribe or are separated by relatively small pre-Neoproterozoic cratonic nuclei, namely the Pampean, Tocantins, Borborema and Mantiqueira provinces. These extra-Amazonian provinces were formed by a complex framework of orogenic branching systems following a diversified post-Mesoproterozoic paleogeographic scenario. This scenario included many types of basement inliers as well as a diversified organization of accretionary and collisional orogens. The basement inliers date from the Archean to Mesoproterozoic periods and are different in nature. The escape tectonics that operated during the final consolidation stages of the provinces were important to and responsible for the final forms currently observed. These latest events, which occurred from the Late Ediacaran to the Early Ordovician, present serious obstacles to paleogeographic reconstructions.

Two groups of orogenic collage systems are identified. The older system from the Tonian (\&gt;850 Ma) period is of restricted occurrence and is not fully understood due to strong reworking subsequent to Tonian times. The second group of orogenies is more extensive and more important. Its development began with diachronic taphrogenic processes in the Early Cryogenian period (ca. 850–750 Ma) and preceded a complex scenario of continental, transitional and oceanic basins. Subsequent orogenies (post 800 Ma) were also created by diachronic processes that ended in the Early Ordovician. More than one orogeny (plate interaction) can be identified either in space or in time in every province. The orogenic processes were not necessarily synchronous in different parts of the orogenic system, even within the same province. This particular group of orogenic collage events is known as the “Brasiliano”.

All of the structural provinces of the extra-Amazonian domain exhibit final events that are marked by extrusion processes, are represented by long lineaments, and are fundamental to unraveling the structural history of the Phanerozoic sedimentary basins.},

	abstract = {The territory of Brazil coincides almost entirely with the South American Platform, the crystalline core of the continent. Its basement is composed of ancient metamorphic and igneous rocks and it has not suffered any tectonic regeneration since the beginning of the
Phanerozoic. Sedimentary rocks with almost horizontal bedding cover this crystalline basement. This latter shows ages as old as Early
Precambrian, although ages between 500 and 1000 m.y. are conspicuously frequent. The cratonic areas became consolidated more than 1700 m.y. ago, whereas the fold belts formed essentially between 500 and 1700 m.y. ago. The sedimentary cover accumulated from the Early Silurian in three large intracratonic basins, until the platform became completely stabilized. A Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous reactivation, caused by the break-up of the ancient Gondwana continent, created another basin sequence chiefly along the Atlantic continental margin. Based on the nature of the crystalline basement rocks and the sedimentary cover, ten structural provinces can be distinguished: Rio Branco Province, in the north of the country, occupied by the Guyana Shield and still only poorly known, with an important fold belt developed during the so-called Transamazonian Cycle (2000 ± 200m.y.) with high-grade metamorphic rocks and only slight influence of later events. Tapajós Province, in central Brazil, corresponding to the Amazonas or {GuaporéCraton}, showing chiefly Precambrian crystalline rocks and behaving as an cratonic area during thePhanerozoic. Sa˜o Francisco Province, located on the Atlantic Shield, with its basement covered by rocks of different ages, chiefly affected by the Brasiliano Cycle (between 1000 and 500 m.y.) and constituting another cratonic area.
Tocantins Province, between the Amazonas and Sa˜o Francisco Cratons, with the oldest rocks in its centre (ages over 2600 m.y.), and at the eastern and western borders metamorphic sequences of various fold belts, and almost no Phanerozoic deposits. Mantiqueira Province, located along the southern part of the Atlantic coast, affected chiefly by the Brasiliano folding cycle. Borborema Province, in the northeast Brazilian fold belt, affected by the Brasiliano Cycle in a very complex way, and with important faulted zones. It was reactivated in Phanerozoic times, when also sedimentary covers accumulated. Amazonas Province, represented by the Amazonas sedimentary basin (syneclise), and subdivided into four parts by three important arcs. Parnaiba Province, coinciding with the Piauf — Maranha˜o syneclise, and filled with a rather thick sedimentary sequence. {ParanáProvince}, the sedimentary basin of southern Brazil, inwhich the well-known Late Paleozoic glaciation features are found, and which possesses an extensive cover of basaltic rocks of Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age. Coastal Province and Continental Margin, the youngest structural unit, developed during the separation of the continent and represented by rift-valleys and coastal basins filled with Mesozoic-Cenozoic deposits of various kinds.},

	abstract = {Este trabalho refere-se a análise faciológica das rochas siliciclásticas da Formação poti (carbonífero Inferior) e das unidades limítrofes (fomações Longá e Piauí), tomando-se como base dados de superfície e de subsuperfície coletados, respectivamente, na borda leste e oeste (Poço 2-IZ-I-MA) da Bacia do Parnaíba. Os resultados deste estudo levaram ao reconhecimento de duas seqüências deposicionais distintas, separadas por discordância. A primeira seqüência inclui depósitos do topo da Formação Longá e base da Formação Poti (Grupo canindé). A segunda seqüência contém depósitos das porções basais da Formação Piauí (Grupo Balsas). A análise faciológica dos dados de superfície revelou que a seqüência Longá (topo)/Poti (base) é representada por depósitos plataformais, litorâneos e fluviais, os quais estão organizados em uma sucessão dominantemente progradante. O ambiente de plataforma é representado por pelitos laminados (lama de offshore), bem como por arenitos finos com estratificação cruzada hummocky, laminação truncada por onda e laminação plano-paralela (introduzidos pela ação de tempestades). Ambientes litorâneos são representados por depósitos de a) shoreface (arenitos finos a médios com estratificação swaley); b) tidal sand ridges (arenitos finos a médios com estratificação cruzada sigmoidal; c) planícies de maré (ritmitos com acamamento flaser, wavy e linsen) d) barras de foreshore (arenitos finos com laminação plano-paralela, fitobioturbados e com lineações de corrente) e e) laguna (siltitos e intercalações arenitos/siltitos com laminação plano-paralela). Os depósitos fluviais são constituídos por arenitos grossos a conglomeráticos com estratificações cruzada tabular e acanalada, interpretados como resultantes de migração de barras e dunas subaquosas em sistema do tipo entrelaçado. Estudo complementar da sequência referida acima, baseando-se em dados de subsuperfície, combinando análise faciológica de testemunhos (Poço 2-IZ-1-MA) com a correlação com outros poços, sugerem deposição em sistemas deltaicos com retrabalhamento por ondas e marés, o qual evoluiu, em parte, para estuário (topo da Formação Poti). Neste contexto deltaico-estuarino, as fácies mais proximais correspondem à Formação Poti e as mais distais à Formação Longá. A análise faciológica de parte da seqüência referente a base da Formação Piauí (Grupo Balsas) revelou depósitos de dunas eólicas, leques aluviais e de wadis, caracterizando um sistema desértico. A sedimentação Piauí foi desenvolvida em um cenário de progressiva de mudança de paleolatitudes, tendendo a bacia a condições climáticas cada vez mais quentes e áridas. Os litotipos rudáceos e a presença de depósitos perturbados evidenciam a presença de abalos sísmicos concomitantes com a deposição, os quais provavelmente, resultaram de movimentações tectônicas relacionadas às manifestações precursoras da agregação do Supercontinente Pangea, durante o Permiano O clima vigente durante a deposição da seqüência Poti-Longá era do tipo temperado, sem evidências de quaisquer influências glacial ou periglacial na sedimentação. Altas taxas de evaporação são sugeridas pela presença das seguintes feições: a) estruturas do tipo teepees, b) concreções de gipsita (rosa do deserto); c) pseudomorfos de minerais evaporíticos e d) crescimento secundário eodiagenético defeldspatos. Durante a deposição da seqüência sobrejacente, condições climáticas mais quentes e áridas prevaleceram, culminando com um período de intensa desertificação da bacia. Acredita-se que a tendência a climas cada vez mais severos possa ser atribuída a agregação do Supercontinente Pangea. A evolução sedimentar das duas seqüências referidas acima só pode ser entendida, considerando-se o quadro geotectônico da Província Sedimentar do Meio-Norte do Brasil, onde estas acham-se inseridas. Esta província, anteriormente considerada como unidade geotectônica única (isto é, Bacia do Parnaíba), apresentou evolução policíclica, o que permite compartimentá-la em diferentes bacias com gêneses e idades distintas (bacias do Parnaíba, das Alpercatas, do Grajaú e do Espigão-Mestre). A Bacia do Parnaíba, com área de 400.000km², representa porção remanente de extensa sedimentação intracratônica afro-brasileira. Três grandes ciclos transgressivos regressivos (correspondentes aos grupos Serra Grande, Canindé e Balsas) são reconhecidos. Estes depósitos acumularam-se do Siluriano até a continentalização da bacia no Triássico, refletindo a formação do Pangea. No Jurássico, em decorrência do início dos processos relacionados com a desagregação do Paleocontinente Gondwana, a região central da Província Sedimentar do Meio-Norte foi abatida, gerando um sistema de riftis denominado de Anficlise das Alpercatas. Este rifteamento atingiu uma área de 70.000km², onde sedimentos fluvio-lacustres (formações Pastos Bons e Corda) acumularam-se, formando uma sucessão de 200m de espessura. Rochas vulcânicas de idades jurássica a eocretácea (formações Mosquito e Sardinha) ocorrem em associação a estes depósitos. No Cretáceo, como resultado da abertura do Atlântico, a sedimentação foi deslocada pala novos sítios deposicionais. Ao norte, Bacia do Grajaú (área de 130.000km²) estabeleceu-se como resultado da fase de subsidência térmica, promovendo a acumulação de 800m de sedimentos eólico-lagunares (formações Codó, Grajaú e Itapecuru). Concomitantemente, uma area de 170.000km² subsidiu ao sul, resultando na Bacia do Espigão-Mestre, onde, pelo menos, 400m de depósitos fluvio-eólicos foram acumulados (Grupo Areado e Formação Urucuia).},

	abstract = {The lithosphere of the South American continent has been studied little, especially in northern Brazil (the Amazonian region). A 3D lithospheric S-velocity model of South America was obtained by first carrying out Rayleigh and Love wave group-velocity tomography, and then inverting the regionalized dispersion curves. Fundamental mode group velocities were measured using a Multiple Filtering Technique. More than 12,000 paths were examined and about 6000 Rayleigh- and 3500 Love-wave dispersion curves with good quality were retrieved. Checkerboard tests showed that our dataset permits the resolution of features 400–800 km across laterally in the central part of the continent from crustal to upper mantle depths. Our results confirm previous tomographic results and correlate well with the major geological provinces of South America. The 3D S-velocity model confirms both regional features of {SE} Brazil from P-wave travel-time tomography and continental-scale features of central and western South America from waveform inversion, e.g., lowest velocities in the Andean upper mantle; three parts of the Nazca plate with flat subduction; strong low-velocity anomalies in the upper-mantle depth beneath the Chaco basin. Furthermore, our 3D model revealed new features in the South American continent: (1) high velocities in the lower crust were consistently found in regions with high Bouguer or free-air anomalies; (2) the {NE}–{SW} trending {TransBrasiliano} shear zone was delineated by a {NE}–{SW} low-velocity belt at lithospheric depths; (3) the eastern Amazonian craton appears to have thicker lithosphere than the western craton; (4) in areas of Archean nuclei located in the northeastern Guaporé shield and southeastern São Francisco craton, high velocity anomalies were found down to 150 km.},

To this end, we analyzed receiver functions from 20 relatively new temporary broadband seismic stations deployed across eastern Brazil. In the analysis we include teleseismic and some regional events, particularly for stations that recorded few suitable earthquakes. We first estimate crustal thickness and average Poisson's ratio using two different stacking methods. We then combine the new crustal constraints with results from previous receiver function studies. To interpolate the crustal thickness between the station locations, we jointly invert these Moho point constraints, Rayleigh wave group velocities, and regional S and Rayleigh waveforms for a continuous map of Moho depth. The new tomographic Moho map suggests that Moho depth and Moho relief vary slightly with age within the Precambrian crust. Whether or not a positive correlation between crustal thickness and geologic age is derived from the pre-interpolation point constraints depends strongly on the selected subset of receiver functions. This implies that using only pre-interpolation point constraints (receiver functions) inadequately samples the spatial variation in geologic age. The new Moho map also reveals an anomalously deep Moho beneath the oldest core of the Amazonian Craton.},

	abstract = {The basement of the South American platform consists of two large distinct geologic domains: the Amazonian or pre-Tonian (N-{NW} portions) and the “Brasiliano” (or “Extra-Amazonian”, the central and eastern portions). These domains are separated by a set of two long linear fault zones, the Transbrasiliano lineament ({NNE}-{SSW}) to the south and the Araguaia lineament ({NS}) to the north.The Amazonian domain consists of large Archaean nuclei surrounded by Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic mobile belts of all of the systems of these eras. These mobile belts strike {NNW}-{SSE}, with indications of crustal growth from {NNE} to {SSW}, as recorded by the belts themselves as well as by subsequent anorogenic plutonism and cratonic covers. The western portion of the Amazonian domain and the basement inliers of the Andean orogenic belt present important affinities in terms of composition and crustal evolution. Most of the general framework and most of the Amazonian domain are akin to those recorded to the north in the Laurentian continent.The Brasiliano domain records a complex orogenic collage, representing branching systems of orogens, dated from tectonic cycles of the Tonian up to the Early Ordovician. This domain includes several minor cratonic nuclei formed of Archaean and Paleoproterozoic rock units, amalgamated by fold belts generated during (at least) five Wilsonian orogenic cycles. Crustal growth follows different centripetal processes because the vergences of the belts are towards the small cratonic nuclei. Aside from the cratons, several other pre-Neoproterozoic terranes were also amalgamated, and submitted to strong tectonic-thermal reactivations. Mesoproterozoic mobile belts have not been detected yet. The few geological records known from the Statherian and from the Mesoproterozoic were reset during the Neoproterozoic tectonism. At the end of the Neoproterozic orogenic cycles, a striking post-collisional scenario led by extrusional tectonics was in place. These processes reshaped the final structural framework of the Brasiliano provinces, distinguishing them from the Amazonian domain. The Brasiliano domain displays many compositional, structural and crustal evolution affinities with those of the westernmost part of the African continent.The more than 4500km long {NNE}-{SSW} Transbrasiliano lineament is the main record of the extrusional processes (from ca. 540Ma onwards) and displays evidence of seismic and faulting activities along the Phanerozoic. The Araguaia lineament is the final record of orogeny and collision, as the result of interactions between the Amazonian craton/plate and the backlands situated to the east in Neoproterozoic times (Colméia-Xambioá, Paranaiba and Granja terranes are good candidates).},

Combined geological and geochronological information indicate that the Paleoproterozoic rocks are part of a Trans-Amazonian/Eburnean orogen initiated by an accretionary phase (2240–2150 Ma), better represented in the adjacent São Luís Craton, and terminated by collisional event (2100–2080 Ma) that amalgamated juvenile and reworked Paleoproterozoic terrains and an Archean terrain existing to the south. This landmass amalgamated in the Paleoproterozoic broke up before 732 Ma, forming a rift, as suggested by the emplacement of the nepheline syenite pluton. The rift received detritus coming from Archean, Paleoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic, and Neoproterozoic sources. We infer that the rift evolved to an oceanic basin and that the closure of this basin occurred at the end of the Neoproterozoic (580–550 Ma), as part of the Brasiliano/Pan-African cycle of orogenies},

	abstract = {The use of broadband receiver function analysis to estimate the fine-scale S-velocity structure of the lithosphere is becoming increasingly popular. A series of numerical experiments shows several important aspects of this technique, with emphasis on estimation of dipping interfaces. The recent modification introduced to the receiver function analysis technique that preserves absolute amplitudes (Ammon, 1991) is more robust than the previous technique of modeling receiver functions that were normalized to unit amplitude. Using the latter method, shallow (e.g., depths less than ∼2 km) high-velocity contrast interfaces may alter the apparent amplitudes of Ps phases and produce inaccuracies in the Earth model developed. The use of absolute amplitudes minimizes this potential for error. When research targets include deep dipping structure, tight stacking bounds (e.g., ≦ 10° in backazimuth ({BAZ}) and epicentral distance (Δ)) should be applied to avoid attenuating Ps phases and to aid in the identification of reverberations or scattered energy. Reverberations sample a relatively large lateral range about the recording site (e.g., a radius of 1 to 1.5 times the depth of the reflecting interface) and in the presence of dipping interfaces exhibit drastic variations in amplitude and arrival time as a function of {BAZ} and Δ. Thus, they cannot readily be used to provide constraints on the Earth structure. Formal inversion techniques, which attempt to match all arrivals in the waveform, must be used with caution when modeling receiver functions from complex regions. Only those phases whose amplitude and arrival-time variations as a function of {BAZ} and Δ are consistent with those of Ps conversions should be modeled. Forward modeling may resolve, depending upon the data quality and noise level, S-velocity contrasts greater than ∼ 0.2 to 0.4 km / sec. Layers of thickness 2 to 5 km may be accurately imaged, and transition zones may be examined by considering various frequency bands of the data. In order to better understand the resolving power of the data, the averaging functions associated with the receiver functions may be calculated from the observed data and, if desired, used in the forward modeling process.},

Inferred collision of both continents is reflected in the Nova Brasilândia and Aguapeí-Sunsas fold belts, as well as in the Llano Uplift area. (ii) In eastern South America small crustal fragments of inferred Rodinia ascent were variably reworked during Neoproterozoic Brasiliano orogenic events, rendering it difficult to recognize and map Meso-Neoproterozoic (Grenvillian) mobile belts. So far, the best candidates to represent possible fragments of such mobile belts were recognized in the Punta del Este, Uruguay, terrain, in the Serra do Itaberaba, São Paulo, eastern Brazil area and in the Cariris Velhos, northeastern Brazil area.

We consider two models that may explain these differences. The first model attributes the difference to a change in the composition of the upper mantle. The higher temperatures in the Archean mantle led to the eruption of komatiitic lavas, resulting in an ultradepleted lithosphere unable to produce significant volumes of basaltic melt. Proterozoic crust developed above fertile mantle, and subsequent partial melting resulted in basaltic underplating and crustal inflation. In the second model, convection in the hot Archean mantle is considered to have been too turbulent to sustain stable long-lived subduction zones. By the Proterozoic the mantle had cooled sufficiently for substantial island and continental arcs to be constructed, and the high-velocity basal layer was formed by basaltic underplating.},

	abstract = {Several recent models of crustal evolution are based on the belief that the thickness of the continental crust is proportional to its age, with ancient crust being the thickest. A worldwide review of seismic structure contradicts this belief and falsifies these models, at least for the Archean. Proterozoic crust has a thickness of 40–55 km and a substantial high-velocity ({\textgreater}7 km/s) layer at its base, while Archean crust is only 27–40 km thick (except at the site of younger rifts and collisional boundaries) and lacks the basal high-velocity layer. Seismology also provides evidence that the lithosphere is thickest beneath Archean cratons, while diamond ages show that this lithospheric keel must have already existed in the Archean. Geochemical data also indicate significant differences between Archean and Proterozoic lithosphere. Major and trace element studies of sediments show a change in upper crustal composition between the Archean and Proterozoic. Archean rocks are depleted in Si and K and enriched in Na, Ca, and Mg. There is also a marked change in the Eu/Eu* ratio. Mantle xenoliths and continental flood basalts show that the mantle lithosphere beneath Archean crust is ultradepleted in {FeO} compared to that beneath post-Archean crust. The secular change in the crust-forming process is attributed to a decline in mantle temperature, leading to a change in the composition of the lithospheric mantle. The higher temperature of the Archean mantle led to the eruption of komatiitic lavas, producing a refractory lithospheric mantle which is ultradepleted in {FeO} and volatiles. The resultant lithospheric keel is intrinsically less dense than the surrounding mantle and thus not susceptible to delamination. It was sufficiently thick and cool for diamonds to form during the Archean. In contrast, Proterozoic crust developed above fertile mantle. The eruption of continental flood basalts and underplating of basaltic sills is attributed to subsequent heating and partial melting of the lithospheric mantle. Consequently, Proterozoic crust is thickened and has a high-velocity basal layer.},

	abstract = {Four intracratonic basins of North America, the Hudson Bay, Michigan, Illinois and Williston basins, have similar ages and are close to one another. Yet, they exhibit different subsidence histories characterised by different time-scales and sediment thicknesses. They can be explained by local lithosphere thinning and by the cooling of the induced thermal anomaly. Within the framework of 1D thermal models for vertical heat transport, each basin requires a different lithosphere thickness or a different boundary condition at the base of the lithosphere. Heat flow and seismic studies show that, beneath the North American craton, the lithosphere is too thick for the assumption of purely vertical heat transfer to be valid. Thermal models are developed to account for finite thermal anomaly width and for two types of basal boundary conditions, fixed temperature or fixed heat flux. Different subsidence histories are explained by deep lithospheric anomalies of different sizes. The stability of thick continental roots requires the mantle part of the lithosphere to be compositionally buoyant with respect to ‘normal’ convecting mantle. Localised lithospheric thinning, due for example to plume penetration, results in the emplacement of compositionally denser mantle into the lithosphere. This represents a load which drives permanent flexure. The cooling time and the characteristics of flexure allow constraints on the dimensions of these deep lithospheric anomalies. There are no solutions for lithosphere thicknesses less than 170 km. The Williston and Illinois basins are associated with wide (∼200 km) and thin anomalies (∼100 km), whereas the Michigan and Hudson Bay are located on top of narrow (∼100 km) and tall (∼200 km) anomalies.},

Basins formed by lithospheric folding are characterized by distinct features in subsidence history. A comparison with extensional basins, foreland basins, intracratonic basins and pull-apart basins provides criteria for the discrimination between these modes of basin formation. These findings are important in deciphering the feedbacks between tectonics and surface processes. In addition, inferences on accommodation space and thermal regime have important consequences for hydrocarbon maturity. Lithospheric folding is coupled to compressional reactivation of basins and faults, and therefore, strongly affects reservoir characteristics of sedimentary basins.},

The cratonic basins have developed against this post break-up background, The cratonic basins of Africa are located between a relatively dense array of highspots and hotspots. Although there is a clear underlying structural fabric in the form of the Central African and West African rift systems, the present location of these basins cannot always be unequivocally linked to the presence of underlying rifts. The Congo Basin stands out as overlying a rigid rather than stretched lithosphere, and no reasonable density contrasts in the crust can explain the isostatic anomalies over the basin. Either there is a cold, dense region situated at depths typical of the upper mantle beneath the basin, or a downward-acting dynamic force on the base of the lithosphere is necessary to explain the gravity field. Together, this points to the likelihood of a convective downwelling beneath the African plate under the Congo region. The African cold-spot model may be applicable to the Early Palaeozoic cratonic basins of North America. Their location and timing of development with respect to the adjacent plate margin, size and shape may be analogous to the African examples.},

Basin subsidence can be largely explained by a postulated Late Proterozoic failed rift and subsequent thermal relaxation. Seismic reflection profiles and well data reveal a Palaeozoic development of the basin punctuated by two regional deformational episodes; one in the Early Palaeozoic (Late Cambrian) and a second in the Late Palaeozoic (Late Permian-Triassic). Both episodes result from {NE}-{SW} contraction, with the Late Palaeozoic episode being largely a reactivation of the Early Palaeozoic structures. The timing of the two deformations correlates with collisional events at continental margins some distance from the Congo Basin. In the Early Palaeozoic the deformation appears to be related to the late stages of the West Congolian fold and thrust belt and coincides regionally with the Pan-African event sensu stricto. The Late Palaeozoic deformation coincides with collisional tectonics along the southern margin of Gondwana and the generation of the Cape and Sierra Ventana Foldbelts. It is postulated that in both the Early and Late Palaeozoic, Africa and Gondwana experienced widespread intracontinental deformation generated by distant collisional processes much as Central Asia is experiencing today.},

Here we use a 1400 km long, deep (20 s two-way travel time) seismic reflection profile, five wide-angle split-spread receiver gathers, gravity anomaly, and well data to constrain the origin of the Parnaíba Basin, a cratonic basin in Northeast Brazil. In the center of the basin, the depth to pre-Paleozoic basement is {\textasciitilde}3.3 km, a zone of midcrustal reflectivity (MCR) can be traced laterally for {\textasciitilde}250 km at depths between 17 and 25 km and Moho depth is {\textasciitilde}42 ± 2 km. Gravity and P wave modeling suggests that the MCR represents the upper surface of a high density (2985 kg m−3) and Vp (6.75–7.0 km s−1) lower crustal body, likely of magmatic origin. Backstripping of well data shows a concave up decreasing tectonic subsidence, similar in form to that observed in rift-type basins. We show, however, that our seismic and gravity data are inconsistent with an extensional origin. Other basin forming mechanisms are therefore required. We show that an intrusive body in the lower crust that has loaded and flexed the surface of the crust, combined with sediment loading, provides a satisfactory fit to the observed gravity anomaly. A buried load model is consistent with seismic data, which suggest that the Moho is as deep or deeper beneath the basin center than its flanks and accounts for at least part of the tectonic subsidence through a viscoelastic stress relaxation that occurs in the lithosphere following load emplacement.},

	abstract = {The Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), emplaced at the Triassic–Jurassic (T–J) boundary ({\textasciitilde} 200 Ma), is among the largest igneous provinces on Earth. The Maranhão basin in NE Brazil is located around 700 km inland and 2000 km from the site of the earliest Pangea disruption. The CAMP tholeiites occur only in the western part of the basin and have been described as low and high-Ti. Here we document the occurrence of two sub-groups among the high-Ti tholeiites in the Western Maranhão basin. The major and trace elements and the Sr–Nd–Pb isotopic ratios define three chemical groups corresponding to the low-Ti (TiO2 \&lt; 1.3 wt.\%), high-Ti (TiO2 {\textasciitilde} 2.0 wt.\%) and evolved high-Ti (TiO2 \&gt; 3 wt.\%) western Maranhão basin tholeiites (WMBT). The new 40Ar/39Ar plateau ages obtained on plagioclase separates for high-Ti (199.7 ± 2.4 Ma) and evolved high-Ti WMBT (197.2 ± 0.5 Ma and 198.2 ± 0.6 Ma) are indistinguishable and identical to those of previously analyzed low-Ti WMBT (198.5 ± 0.8 Ma) and to the mean 40Ar/39Ar age of the CAMP (199 ± 2.4 Ma). We also present the first Re–Os isotopic data for CAMP basalts. The low and high-Ti samples display mantle-like initial (187Os/188Os)i ranging from 0.1267 to 0.1299, while the evolved high-Ti samples are more radiogenic ((187Os/188Os)i up to 0.184) We propose that the high-Ti WMBT were derived from the sub-lithospheric asthenosphere, and contaminated during ascent by interaction with the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). The evolved high-Ti WMBT were derived from the same asthenospheric source but experienced crustal contamination. The chemical characteristics of the low-Ti group can be explained by partial melting of the most fertile portions of the SCLM metasomatized during paleo-subduction. Alternatively, the low-Ti WMBT could be derived from the sub-lithospheric asthenosphere but the resulting melts may have undergone contamination by the SCLM. The occurrences of high-Ti basalts are apparently not restricted to the area of initial continental disruption which may bring into question previous interpretations such as those relating high-Ti CAMP magmatism to the initiation of Atlantic ridge spreading or as the expression of a deep mantle plume. We propose that the CAMP magmatism in the Maranhão basin may be attributed to local hotter mantle conditions due to the combined effects of edge-driven convection and large-scale mantle warming under the Pangea supercontinent. The involvement of a mantle-plume with asthenosphere-like isotopic characteristics cannot be ruled out either as one of the main source components of the WMBT or as a heat supplier.},

The first event consists of a rapid stretching of continental lithosphere, which produces thinning and passive upwelling of hot asthenosphere. This stage is associated with block faulting and subsidence. The lithosphere then thickens by heat conduction to the surface, and further slow subsidence occurs which is not associated with faulting. The slow subsidence and the heat flow depend only on the amount of stretching, which can be estimated from these quantities and from the change in thickness of the continental crust caused by the extension. The model is therefore easily tested. Preliminary investigations of the Great Basin, the Aegean, the North Sea and the Michigan Basin suggest that the model can account for the major events in their evolution.},

	abstract = {Surface wave tomography using Rayleigh waves has shown that Tibet and the surrounding mountain ranges that are now being shortened are underlain by thick lithosphere, of similar thickness to that beneath cratons. Both their elevation and lithospheric thickness can result from pure shear shortening of normal thickness continental lithosphere by about a factor of two. The resulting thermal evolution of the crust and lithosphere is dominated by radioactive decay in the crust. It raises the temperature of the lower part of the crust and of the upper part of the lithosphere to above their solidus temperatures, generating granites and small volumes of mafic alkaline rocks from beneath the Moho, as well as generating high temperature metamorphic assemblages in the crust. Thermal models of this process show that it can match the P, T estimates determined from metamorphic xenoliths from Tibet and the Pamirs, and can also match the compositions of the alkaline rocks. The seismological properties of the upper part of the lithosphere beneath northern Tibet suggest that it has already been heated by the blanketing effect and radioactivity of the thick crust on top. If the crustal thickness is reduced by erosion alone to its normal value at low elevations, without any tectonic extension, over a time scale that is short compared to the thermal time constant of thick lithosphere, of ∼250 Ma, thermal subsidence will produce a basin underlain by thick lithosphere. Though this simple model accounts for the relevant observations, there is not yet sufficient information available to be able to model in detail the resulting thermal evolution of the sediments deposited in such cratonic basins.},

O principal objetivo desta pesquisa é a cartografia geofísica regional desses corpos magmáticos com base em técnicas de realce de anomalias magnéticas e mapeamento semiautomático (SOM). Um vasto conjunto de dados magnéticos aerolevantados foi processado e interpretado com o objetivo de cartografar a distribuição da atividade ígnea na Bacia do Parnaíba. Os mapas geofísicos resultantes indicam que o magmatismo mosquito tem proeminente ocorrência nas bordas oeste e sul da bacia, enquanto que o magmatismo sardinha está concentrado nas porções centro-leste e nordeste. Dados de susceptibilidade magnética das rochas magmáticas permitiram individualizar os dois principais eventos magmáticos mesozoicos, constatando que a Formação Sardinha exibe susceptibilidade magnética média aproximadamente duas vezes maior que a Formação Mosquito, revelando uma diferenciação composicional desses dois eventos magmáticos. Análise comparativa entre seções sísmicas, dados magnéticos e geológicos de superfície revela que a ocorrência das rochas magmáticas é muito mais extensa em subsuperfície e que soleiras e diques ocorrem principalmente intercalados entre as sequências tectono-sedimentares paleozoicas.

	abstract = {Cratonic basins are sites of prolonged, broadly distributed but slow subsidence of the continental lithosphere, and are commonly filled with shallow water and terrestrial sedimentary rocks. They remain poorly understood geodynamically. A number of models have been proposed that fall into families involving cooling of stretched continental lithosphere, cooling related to mantle flow (dynamic topography), densification of the underlying lithosphere due to phase changes, the surface response to magmatism and/or plume activity, and long-wavelength buckling under in-plane stresses. The timing of initiation and spatial distribution of cratonic basin formation are linked to geodynamic phases within the overall framework of plate amalgamation and supercontinental break-up and dispersal. Many cratonic basins initiated in the Neoproterozoic and Cambrian-Ordovician. Some suites of cratonic basins originated as broad ramp-like realms of subsidence tilting down to the adjacent passive margin, and were later “individualized” by secondary processes such as, for instance, reactivation of tectonic structures during intracontinental orogeny, and the emergence of intervening arches and domes. Several different mechanisms may therefore control the geological evolution and subsidence history of cratonic basins during their long life-times. We propose that a model of low strain rate extension accompanied and followed by cooling of the underlying lithosphere satisfactorily explains the long-term subsidence history of a range of cratonic basins. However, the precise role played by dynamic topography transmitted from large-scale mantle flow in initiating or modifying the elevation history of continental interiors remains an intriguing focus for further research.},

	abstract = {Maps of Rayleigh wave group velocity are presented across Brazil at periods between 6 and 23 s from seismic noise tomography. This range is complementary to previous continent-scale tomographic studies, which generally focus on periods longer than 10 s. By cross-correlating ambient noise recorded at 53 stations from 1996 to 2012, we produce empirical Green's functions between about 550 pairs of stations. From these, group velocity dispersion curves are measured by applying a frequency–time analysis with phase-matched filtering. At periods shorter than 23 s, 200–300 measurements pass the selection criteria, which are based on the signal-to-noise ratio and seasonal variability. Further filtering is performed by rejecting measured velocities too incompatible with maps produced from overdamped tomographic inversions. The final group velocity maps have a spatial resolution typically better than 400–500 km within most of the eastern half of Brazil, and slightly degrading toward shorter and longer periods of the study. The dispersion maps depict a strong correlation with sediment thickness and large-scale geological features, such as the São Francisco craton, surrounding mobile belts and intracratonic basins. The observed trends in group velocity and preliminary 1-D shear velocity models inferred from a Markov chain Monte Carlo exploration at three selected locations, are consistent with previous local seismic studies of the crustal structure. However, comparison with velocities from continent-scale earthquake tomography reveals diverging trends in some regions that deserve further investigation. As broad-band station coverage is rapidly expanding in Brazil, a full inversion to retrieve the 3-D crustal and uppermost mantle structure from ambient noise tomography should become possible in the near future.},
