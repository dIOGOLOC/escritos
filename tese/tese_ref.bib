	abstract = {We consider the deconvolution of a suite of teleseismic recordings of the same event in order to separate source and transmission path phenomena. The assumption of source uniformity may restrict the range of azimuths and distances of the seismograms included in the suite. The source shape is estimated by separately averaging the log amplitude spectra and the phase spectra of the recordings. This method of source estimation uses the redundant source information contained in secondary arrivals. The necessary condition for this estimator to resolve the source wavelet is that the travel times of the various secondary arrivals be evenly distributed with respect to the initial arrivals. The subsequent deconvolution of the seismograms is carried out by spectral division with two modifications. The first is the introduction of a minimum allowable source spectral amplitude termed the waterlevel. This parameter constrains the gain of the deconvolution filter in regions where the seismogram has little or no information, and also trades-off arrival time resolution with arrival amplitude resolution. The second modification, designed to increase the time domain resolution of the deconvolution, is the extension of the frequency range of the transmission path impulse response spectrum beyond the optimal passband (the passband of the seismograms). The justification for the extension lies in the fact that the impulse response of the transmission path is itself a series of impulses which means its spectrum is not band-limited. Thus, the impulse response is best represented by a continuous spectrum rather than one which is set to zero outside the optimal passband. This continuity is achieved by a recursive application of a unit-step prediction operator determined by Burg's maximum entropy algorithm. The envelopes of the deconvolution are used to detect the presence of phase shifted arrivals.},

	abstract = {The use of broadband receiver function analysis to estimate the fine-scale S-velocity structure of the lithosphere is becoming increasingly popular. A series of numerical experiments shows several important aspects of this technique, with emphasis on estimation of dipping interfaces. The recent modification introduced to the receiver function analysis technique that preserves absolute amplitudes (Ammon, 1991) is more robust than the previous technique of modeling receiver functions that were normalized to unit amplitude. Using the latter method, shallow (e.g., depths less than ∼2 km) high-velocity contrast interfaces may alter the apparent amplitudes of Ps phases and produce inaccuracies in the Earth model developed. The use of absolute amplitudes minimizes this potential for error. When research targets include deep dipping structure, tight stacking bounds (e.g., ≦ 10° in backazimuth ({BAZ}) and epicentral distance (Δ)) should be applied to avoid attenuating Ps phases and to aid in the identification of reverberations or scattered energy. Reverberations sample a relatively large lateral range about the recording site (e.g., a radius of 1 to 1.5 times the depth of the reflecting interface) and in the presence of dipping interfaces exhibit drastic variations in amplitude and arrival time as a function of {BAZ} and Δ. Thus, they cannot readily be used to provide constraints on the Earth structure. Formal inversion techniques, which attempt to match all arrivals in the waveform, must be used with caution when modeling receiver functions from complex regions. Only those phases whose amplitude and arrival-time variations as a function of {BAZ} and Δ are consistent with those of Ps conversions should be modeled. Forward modeling may resolve, depending upon the data quality and noise level, S-velocity contrasts greater than ∼ 0.2 to 0.4 km / sec. Layers of thickness 2 to 5 km may be accurately imaged, and transition zones may be examined by considering various frequency bands of the data. In order to better understand the resolving power of the data, the averaging functions associated with the receiver functions may be calculated from the observed data and, if desired, used in the forward modeling process.},
