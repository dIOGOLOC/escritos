	abstract = {We consider the deconvolution of a suite of teleseismic recordings of the same event in order to separate source and transmission path phenomena. The assumption of source uniformity may restrict the range of azimuths and distances of the seismograms included in the suite. The source shape is estimated by separately averaging the log amplitude spectra and the phase spectra of the recordings. This method of source estimation uses the redundant source information contained in secondary arrivals. The necessary condition for this estimator to resolve the source wavelet is that the travel times of the various secondary arrivals be evenly distributed with respect to the initial arrivals. The subsequent deconvolution of the seismograms is carried out by spectral division with two modifications. The first is the introduction of a minimum allowable source spectral amplitude termed the waterlevel. This parameter constrains the gain of the deconvolution filter in regions where the seismogram has little or no information, and also trades-off arrival time resolution with arrival amplitude resolution. The second modification, designed to increase the time domain resolution of the deconvolution, is the extension of the frequency range of the transmission path impulse response spectrum beyond the optimal passband (the passband of the seismograms). The justification for the extension lies in the fact that the impulse response of the transmission path is itself a series of impulses which means its spectrum is not band-limited. Thus, the impulse response is best represented by a continuous spectrum rather than one which is set to zero outside the optimal passband. This continuity is achieved by a recursive application of a unit-step prediction operator determined by Burg's maximum entropy algorithm. The envelopes of the deconvolution are used to detect the presence of phase shifted arrivals.},

	abstract = {The use of broadband receiver function analysis to estimate the fine-scale S-velocity structure of the lithosphere is becoming increasingly popular. A series of numerical experiments shows several important aspects of this technique, with emphasis on estimation of dipping interfaces. The recent modification introduced to the receiver function analysis technique that preserves absolute amplitudes (Ammon, 1991) is more robust than the previous technique of modeling receiver functions that were normalized to unit amplitude. Using the latter method, shallow (e.g., depths less than ∼2 km) high-velocity contrast interfaces may alter the apparent amplitudes of Ps phases and produce inaccuracies in the Earth model developed. The use of absolute amplitudes minimizes this potential for error. When research targets include deep dipping structure, tight stacking bounds (e.g., ≦ 10° in backazimuth ({BAZ}) and epicentral distance (Δ)) should be applied to avoid attenuating Ps phases and to aid in the identification of reverberations or scattered energy. Reverberations sample a relatively large lateral range about the recording site (e.g., a radius of 1 to 1.5 times the depth of the reflecting interface) and in the presence of dipping interfaces exhibit drastic variations in amplitude and arrival time as a function of {BAZ} and Δ. Thus, they cannot readily be used to provide constraints on the Earth structure. Formal inversion techniques, which attempt to match all arrivals in the waveform, must be used with caution when modeling receiver functions from complex regions. Only those phases whose amplitude and arrival-time variations as a function of {BAZ} and Δ are consistent with those of Ps conversions should be modeled. Forward modeling may resolve, depending upon the data quality and noise level, S-velocity contrasts greater than ∼ 0.2 to 0.4 km / sec. Layers of thickness 2 to 5 km may be accurately imaged, and transition zones may be examined by considering various frequency bands of the data. In order to better understand the resolving power of the data, the averaging functions associated with the receiver functions may be calculated from the observed data and, if desired, used in the forward modeling process.},

	abstract = {The deep crustal structure of the Parana Basin of southern Brazil is investigated by analyzing P- and {PP}-wave receiver functions at 17 Brazilian Lithosphere Seismic Project stations within the basin. The study area can be described as a typical Paleozoic intracratonic basin that hosts one of the largest Large Igneous Province of the world and makes a unique setting for investigating models of basin subsidence and their interaction with mantle plumes. Our study consists of (1) an analysis of the Moho interaction phases in the receiver functions to obtain the thickness and bulk Vp/Vs ratio of the basin`s underlying crust and (2) a joint inversion with Rayleigh-wave dispersion velocities from an independent tomographic study to delineate the detailed S-wave velocity variation with depth. The results of our analysis reveal that Moho depths and bulk Vp/Vs ratios (including sediments) vary between 41 and 48 km and between 1.70 and 1.76, respectively, with the largest values roughly coinciding with the basin`s axis, and that S-wave velocities in the lower crust are generally below 3.8 km/s. Select sites within the basin, however, show lower crustal S-wave velocities slightly above 3.9 km/s suggestive of underplated mafic material. We show that these observations are consistent with a fragmented cratonic root under the Parana basin that defined a zone of weakness for the initial Paleozoic subsidence of the basin and which allowed localized mafic underplating of the crust along the suture zones by Cenozoic magmatism.},

	abstract = {We estimate crustal structure and thickness of South America north of roughly 40°S. To this end, we analyzed receiver functions from 20 relatively new temporary broadband seismic stations deployed across eastern Brazil. In the analysis we include teleseismic and some regional events, particularly for stations that recorded few suitable earthquakes. We first estimate crustal thickness and average Poisson's ratio using two different stacking methods. We then combine the new crustal constraints with results from previous receiver function studies. To interpolate the crustal thickness between the station locations, we jointly invert these Moho point constraints, Rayleigh wave group velocities, and regional S and Rayleigh waveforms for a continuous map of Moho depth. The new tomographic Moho map suggests that Moho depth and Moho relief vary slightly with age within the Precambrian crust. Whether or not a positive correlation between crustal thickness and geologic age is derived from the pre-interpolation point constraints depends strongly on the selected subset of receiver functions. This implies that using only pre-interpolation point constraints (receiver functions) inadequately samples the spatial variation in geologic age. The new Moho map also reveals an anomalously deep Moho beneath the oldest core of the Amazonian Craton.},

	abstract = {Teleseismic long-period P waves recorded at the World-Wide Standard Seismograph Network station {LON} (Longmire, Washington) are shown to exhibit strong anomalous particle motion not attributable to instrument miscalibration or malfunction. In particular, a large and azimuthally smoothly varying tangential component is observed after vector rotation of horizontal P waves into the ray direction and after application of a deconvolution technique which equalizes effective source time functions and removes the instrument response. These tangential waves attain amplitudes comparable to the radial component and demonstrate wave form antisymmetry about a {NNE} azimuth. A model which contains a single high-contrast interface dipping toward the {NNE} at a depth of 15–20 km can explain most of the characteristics of the long-period P wave data, provided dips are greater than about 10° and only the interference of P and Ps generated at the interface is considered. The model breaks down for later arrivals which are presumably multiples or scattered waves. Examination of long-period S waves from several deep teleseisms shows a prominent Sp arrival 18 s before S. The timing of this phase conversion suggests an interface at about 145-km depth, and its sense of polarity suggests that the velocity contrast is from higher to lower velocities as depth decreases. This interface may correspond to the bottom of the upper mantle low-velocity zone in the area.},
