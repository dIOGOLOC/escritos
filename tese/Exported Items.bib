	abstract = {We describe and apply an iterative, time-domain deconvolution approach to receiver-function estimation and illustrate the reliability and advantages of the technique using synthetic- and observation-based examples. The iterative technique is commonly used in earthquake time-function studies and offers several advantages in receiver-function analysis such as intuitively stripping the largest receiver-function arrivals from the observed seismograms first and then the details; long-period stability by a priori constructing the deconvolution as a sum of Gaussian pulses; and easy generalization to allow multiwaveform deconvolution for a single receiver-function estimate.},
