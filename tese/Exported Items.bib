	abstract = {Here, we evaluate the improvement in noise correlation functions ({NCFs}) gained by dividing ambient seismic records into shorter, overlapping time windows before correlation and stacking (Welch's method). We compare waveform convergence of short duration {NCF} stacks (e.g. 2, 5, 15 and 50 d stacks) towards the long-term (365 d) {NCF} stack. We observe short duration {NCF} improvement when applying Welch's method for non–pre-processed and running normalized time-series and short duration {NCF} degradation when applied to a ‘one-bit’ normalized time-series. Surprisingly, non–pre-processed time-series provides the quickest convergence to a robust (year-long) {NCF}. Because of the simplicity of Welch's method, the improved {NCF} convergence and a minimal increase in computation, we recommend applying Welch's method for future ambient seismic field analyses. Using this approach will likely improve future {NCF} analyses, particularly for studies with limited duration recordings, high levels of intermittent local or site noise and studies attempting to evaluate temporal variations in subsurface structure.},
